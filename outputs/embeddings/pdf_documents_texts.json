INTRODUCTION\nThe US banking sector is very concerned about financial transaction fraud, which makes sophisticated\ndetection techniques more important algorithms. Traditional methods are hampered by their reactive nature and\ninability to handle vast volumes of data instantly, are gradually being AI-based solutions have taken its place.\nThis study examines the application of artificial intelligence to real-time fraud detection, describing its\n1Nagababu Kandula et al / Int. J. of Intel Adv Res in Eng Compts. Vol-12(4) 2024 [1-9]\nadvantages, disadvantages, and potential applications developments. Furthermore, maintaining a balance\nbetween Model performance, legal specifications, and moral principles continue to be crucial concerns.\nNotwithstanding these challenges, ongoing developments in AI offer significant potential. Improved data\nanalytics, partnerships between financial institutions and AI developers, along with supportive regulatory\nframeworks, will foster innovation and strengthen fraud detection systems [1].ConventionalRule-based systems\nand historical data analysis-based fraud detection techniques are unable to combat the changing strategies of\nfraudsters. As a result, the financial industry is under increasing pressure to implement advanced technologies\nthat can identify fraud immediately and effectively.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become a key tool in this ongoing battle against financial fraud [2].\nWhile AI has significant prospects for enhancing fraud detection, while addressing concerns like data privacy,\ninterpretability, and algorithm openness need to be carefully addressed. Nevertheless, continued Research and\ndevelopment on AI-powered fraud detection has great promise for improving banking's accuracy and efficiency,\nif the ethical and practical challenges are effectively managed to ensure safe implementation [3]. Legacy Fraud\ndetection systems, which mostly use rule-based techniques, are becoming more and more sophisticated in\ncomparison to the sophisticated techniques employed by modern scammers. These antiquated systems can fall\nbehind the rapidly changing digital fraud landscape, leading to frequent false positives and delayed responses.\nWith the growing volume given the intricacy of financial transactions, quick, precise, and real-time fraud\ndetection is essential solutions [4]. AI has improved operational efficiency across the financial sector and has\ntransformed how organizations address key challenges such as fraud detection and transaction processing. As\nthe volume and complexity of financial transactions continue to increase, conventional methods are proving\ninadequate, prompting a shift toward AI-powered solutions. Fraud poses a serious risk to financial institutions,\nleading to significant financial losses and eroding customer trust. Recent estimates suggest that global financial\nfraud could reach trillions of dollars annually, underscoring the urgent need for more advanced and proactive\ndetection mechanisms [5]. It is crucial to maintain the integrity of financial transactions in the digital banking\nindustry. While digital platforms offer unparalleled convenience, they also increase customer vulnerability to\ncyber threats, particularly bank account breaches. Fraud poses a serious threat to global economic stability,\nfinancial security, and trust in financial institutions. Electronic banking and credit card fraud cause significant\nannual losses, necessitating robust detection strategies. In response, financial institutions are actively\ninvestigating emerging fraud techniques [6].\nThe study also explores the moral and legal implications of financial fraud involving AI and machine\nlearning detection, addressing key concerns such as privacy, accountability, and transparency in decision-\nmaking. By deepening our understanding of how these technologies can be used to combat financial fraud, the\nresearch seeks to provide meaningful insights that will influence the evolution of fraud prevention and financial\nsecurity strategies. Ultimately, incorporating AI and ML into fraud detection systems will transform the\nfinancial security landscape, empowering organizations to respond more quickly and accurately in protecting\ntheir assets and customers [7]. By analysing case studies of machine learning-based this study emphasizes the\nefficiency of intelligent systems in safeguarding private information and financial assets through fraud detection\nin the domains of banking, e-commerce, and cyber security. Future studies ought to look into how emerging\ntechnologies such as Fraud detection capabilities can be significantly improved by explainable AI (XAI) and\nquantum computing. Machine learning enables businesses to improve data protection, increase detection\nprecision, lessen monetary losses, and help create a more secure digital landscape [8]. This in-depth overview of\nAI-powered fraud detection and prevention explores the key principles of artificial intelligence. It explores a\nvariety of machine learning methods, such as advanced deep learning, that are frequently employed in fraud\ndetection approaches. Fundamental concepts are clarified, with particular emphasis on the role of generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) in developing innovative strategies for fraud prevention [9]. Cloud computing\nenhances AI-driven fraud detection by providing the computational scalability, flexible storage, and real-time\nprocessing required for comprehensive financial fraud analysis. Cloud-based platforms use distributed\ncomputing to handle high-speed transaction data, allowing for near-instantaneous fraud detection with minimal\nlatency. Additionally, cloud infrastructure supports the exchange of fraud intelligence among organizations,\nenabling financial institutions to work together to detect and combat fraud across global payment systems.\nBeyond increasing detection accuracy, the combination of AI and cloud computing strengthens fraud prevention\nthrough adaptive recognition algorithms [10].\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS\nMaterials\nTransaction Amount\nTransaction amount refers to the absolute monetary value exchanged between parties during a financial\ntransaction. It refers to the amount of money sent from one party to another, which typically occurs in\npurchases, payments, or financial transfers. Depending on the situation, it may also account for taxes, fees, or\n2Nagababu Kandula et al / Int. J. of Intel Adv Res in Eng Compts. Vol-12(4) 2024 [1-9]\ndiscounts. Accurate tracking of transaction amounts is essential for accounting, fraud detection, financial\nvaluations, and ensuring clarity in personal and organizational financial activities.\nTransaction Time\nTransaction time refers to the exact date and time a financial transaction is made or finalized. It acts as\na time stamp indicating when the exchange of money or services takes place, which is essential for\ndocumentation, audits, and the detection of fraudulent activities. Accurate transaction time helps detect unusual\nbehaviour, verify account transactions, and comply with legal and regulatory standards. It is critical for ensuring\ntransparency and accountability in both personal and corporate finances.\nIs Fraud\nFraud is the intentional act of deception intended to achieve illegal or unethical financial gain. It\ntypically involves the manipulation of information, systems, or transactions to deceive others for personal or\norganizational gain. Examples include credit card fraud, identity theft, and fraudulent financial reporting. Fraud\nposes significant threats to individuals, organizations, and the broader economy, resulting in financial losses,\ndamage to trust, and the need for robust detection and prevention strategies to protect financial systems and data\nintegrity.\nFraud Risk Score\nA fraud risk score is a numerical indicator that reflects the probability of fraudulent behaviour\nassociated with a transaction, user, or account. It is generated using algorithms or machine learning techniques\nthat evaluate elements such as behavioural trends, transaction records, and irregularities. A higher score\nindicates an increased level of risk. This scoring algorithm helps financial institutions streamline investigations,\nimprove automated fraud detection, implement preventive measures, reduce financial losses, and strengthen\noverall security.\nInstructions for machine learning\nRandom Forest Regression\nIn machine learning, random forest regression is an ensemble technique and supervised learning\nalgorithm. It builds multiple decision trees independently and in parallel to make predictions. This approach,\noften called packing, reduces prediction variance by building a large number of estimates for the same input.\nCompared to single decision trees, random forests are less likely to be over fitted, producing more accurate\nresults with fewer training cycles. This method averages the outputs from different subsets of the training data\nused to build deep decision trees, which is intended to reduce variance. Although this can slightly increase bias\nand reduce model accuracy, it usually leads to a significant improvement in overall model performance.\nSupport Vector Regression\nOne kind of support vector machine (SVM) intended for regression applications is support vector\nregression (SVR). The objective is to identify a function that closely resembles a continuoustarget variable\nwhile balancing accuracy and model complexity by minimizing prediction errors. A widely used supervised\nlearning method in machine learning, SVM is used in both classification and regression, with its primary\nstrength in binary classification being its ability to partition data into two groups. The purpose of an SVM is to\ndetermine the optimal decision boundary that best separates the classes. The data points that are most important\nfor defining this boundary are called support vectors. The margin shows how far these support vectors are from\nthe decision boundary, which reflects the performance of the class separation.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nIt provides data on fraud detection in AI-protected financial transactions. It consists of four main\nvariables: transaction amount, transaction time, fraud indicator, and fraud risk score. The transaction amount\nshows the monetary value involved, while the transaction time indicates the hour of the transaction. The fraud\nindicator shows whether or whether the transaction is fraudulent (1). The fraud risk score measures the\nlikelihood of fraud based on AI analysis. Higher scores generally correspond to higher fraud risk. The dataset\nillustrates how AI models assess transactions in real-time, using these features to effectively identify and predict\nfraudulent activities.\n3Nagababu Kandula et al / Int.

The average transaction amount was approximately 468, with a\nwide range from about 22 to almost 987, indicating a high degree of variability. Transactions occurred multiple\ntimes, ranging from 0 to 23 units, with an average of 10. Fraud was relatively rare, with only about 16% of\ntransactions being flagged as fraudulent. Fraud risk scores varied widely, with an average of 31 but ranging\nfrom 1 to 99. The standard deviations indicate a considerable spread in the sizes, times, and risk scores,\nhighlighting the different transaction patterns and risk levels.\nEffect of Process Parameters\nFig 1: Scatter plot of the variousFraud Detection 20 with AI Securing Financial Transactions\n4Nagababu Kandula et al / Int. J. of Intel Adv Res in Eng Compts. Vol-12(4) 2024 [1-9]\nFigure 1 presents a detailed scatter plot matrix that analyses key variables in fraud detection for financial\ntransactions. The visualization reveals several important patterns: transaction amounts show a broad distribution\nwith some high value outliers, transaction time clustering over specific time periods indicates temporal fraud\npatterns, and the fraud indicator (Is Fraud) shows the binary nature of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.\nFraud risk scores show a right-skewed distribution, with most transactions receiving low risk scores, while a\nsmall subset shows a high fraud probability, indicating the efficiency of the model in determining suspicious\nactivity.\nFig 2: Heat map of the connection between results and process parameters\nThis Figure 2 correlation heat map reveals the relationships between key fraud detection variables in financial\ntransactions. The most notable finding is the strong positive correlation between Is Fraud and Fraud Risk Score\n(0.89), indicating The AI model's remarkable prediction accuracy fraudulent activities. Transaction Amount\nshows weak negative correlations with both fraud indicators (-0.11 and -0.045), indicating that fraudulent\ntransactions are not necessarily characterized by high volumes. Transaction Time shows the least correlation\namong all variables, indicating that temporal patterns alone are not sufficient predictors of fraud, emphasizing\nthe importance of multidimensional risk assessment approaches.\nRandom Forest Regression\nFig 3: Random Forest Regression (Training data)\n5Nagababu Kandula et al / Int.

The points that are in tight alignment with the diagonal reference line show\nthat the expected and actual fraud risk scores. The model shows excellent prediction accuracy throughout the\nwhole risk score range, from low risk (0\u201320) to high risk (80-100) transactions. The tight clustering around the\ncorrect prediction line indicates minimal prediction error and confirms the effectiveness of the random forest\nalgorithm in learning complex patterns within the fraud detection dataset during training.\nFig 4: Random Forest Regression (Testing data)\nThis Figure 4 scatterplot evaluates the performance of the random forest regression model on unobserved test\ndata for fraud risk score prediction. Unlike the training data results, the test performance shows a high variance\nfrom the diagonal reference line, indicating some over fitting in the model. While high-risk transactions (range\n60-90) maintain reasonable prediction accuracy, there is significant dispersion in the low to moderate risk\nranges. The reduced clustering around the correct prediction line compared to the training data indicates that the\ngeneralization ability of the model is acceptable, but could benefit from regularization techniques to improve\nrobustness on new data.\nTable 2:Performance Metrics of Random Forest Regression (Training Data and Testing Data)\nMax\nData Symbol Model R2 EVS MSE RMSE MAE Error MSLE MedAE\nRandom Forest\nTrain RFR Regression 0.96171 0.96183 20.01560 4.47388 3.82492 10.17000 0.14262 3.72000\nRandom Forest\nTest RFR Regression 0.76533 0.76761 193.61660 13.91462 11.57857 22.87000 0.94850 11.24000\nTable 2 shows the performance metrics of the random forest regression (RFR) model on both the training and\ntest datasets. On the training data, the model exhibits remarkable performance, with a high R\u00b2 of 0.96, indicating\nstrong predictive accuracy, and low error values such as an RMSE of 4.47 and an MAE of 3.82. However, the\ntest data exhibits reduced performance, with an R\u00b2 of 0.77 and considerably more mistakes, with an RMSE of\n13.91 and an MAE of 11.58 \u2013 indicating some over fitting. Metrics such as Max Error and MSLE also increase\nsignificantly in the test, highlighting the challenges in generalizing the model to unseen data.\n6Nagababu Kandula et al / Int.

Vol-12(4) 2024 [1-9]\nSupport Vector Regression\nFig 5:Support Vector Regression (Training data)\nFigure 5 illustrates the performance of using the training data and the support vector regression model for fraud\nrisk score prediction. The results show moderate prediction accuracy, especially in the low to moderate risk\nranges (0-40), with significant deviation from the best diagonal line. Although high-risk transactions (60-100)\nshow better alignment with the actual scores, there is considerable dispersion across the prediction range. The\nSVR model appears to struggle with accurate predictions compared to the Random Forest approach, indicating\nthat the nonlinear relationships in the fraud detection data may be better captured by ensemble methods than\nkernel-based regression techniques.\nFig 6: Support Vector Regression (Testing data)\nFigure 6 shows a scatterplot of the performance of the support vector regression model in testing the data for\nfraud risk score prediction. The results reveal significant challenges in the generalization ability of the model,\nwith significant deviation from the best-fit diagonal prediction line. The scattered data points show inconsistent\nprediction accuracy across different risk score ranges, with some high-risk transactions correctly identified\n7Nagababu Kandula et al / Int. J. of Intel Adv Res in Eng Compts. Vol-12(4) 2024 [1-9]\nwhile others show poor alignment. The limited clustering around the reference line indicates that SVR struggles\nwith over fitting and may not effectively capture complex fraud detection methods when applied to unseen data.\nTable 3:Performance Metrics of Support Vector Regression (Training Data and Testing Data)\nTrai Support Vector 0.8040 0.8069 102.440 10.1212 24.1567 0.4480 5.5282\nn SV Regression 4 7 40 9 7.32380 7 5 1\nSV Support Vector 0.7771 0.7889 183.835 13.5585 10.7821 21.5010 0.8858 7.7099\nTest R Regression 9 2 50 9 3 8 4 5\nTable 3 summarizes the performance of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model on the training and testing\ndatasets. On the training data, SVR shows moderate accuracy with 0.80 R\u00b2 and 10.12 RMSE, indicating a\nreasonable fit but high error compared to random forest regression. The testing data exhibits slightly lower\nperformance with 0.78 R\u00b2 and increased errors, including RMSE 13.56 and MAE 10.78. The Max Error and\nMSLE values are also higher during testing, reflecting some decrease in prediction accuracy on the unseen data,\nalthough overall SVR maintains stable performance between the phases of testing and training.\n4. CONCLUSION\nThis research demonstrates the significant potential Using machine learning and artificial intelligence\ntechnology in transforming fraud detection for financial transactions. A comparative analysis between random\nforest regression and support vector regression reveals unique performance characteristics that inform practical\nimplementation results. Random forest regression emerged as the best approach, achieving exceptional training\nperformance with an R\u00b2 of 0.96 and minimal error metrics (RMSE: 4.47, MAE: 3.82). However, the model\nshowed some over fitting tendencies, as evidenced by reduced testing performance (R\u00b2 of 0.77, RMSE: 13.91).\nSupport vector regression showed more consistent but moderate performance in both training (R\u00b2 of 0.80) and\ntesting phases (R\u00b2 of 0.78), indicating better generalization capabilities despite lower overall accuracy. The\nstrong correlation between actual fraud indicators and AI-generated fraud risk scores (0.89) confirms the\neffectiveness of machine learning approaches in identifying fraudulent activities. The analysis revealed that\ntransaction sizes show minimal correlation with fraud occurrences, emphasizing that sophisticated AI models\ncan detect fraud patterns beyond traditional rule-based systems that rely heavily on transaction size limitations.\nKey findings show that although AI-powered solutions perform noticeably better than traditional fraud detection\ntechniques, challenges remain in model generalization and over fitting prevention. The integration of cloud\ncomputing infrastructure enhances real-time processing capabilities, enabling immediate fraud detection with\nminimal latency. Future studies should concentrate on creating hybrid models that include the precision of\nensemble methods with advanced generalization capabilities. Additionally, the addition of explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques will address transparency concerns while maintaining detection performance. Implementing\nregularization techniques and cross-validation strategies can mitigate over fitting issues found in high-\nperformance models. The study confirms that fraud detection solutions driven by AI can greatly improve\nfinancial security frameworks and lower false positives, and improve response times, ultimately protecting both\nconsumers and financial institutions from new fraud risks in the world of online banking.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Various studies and opinions\nshow that online transaction activity has grown substantially in the past few years,\nand this field should see much more progress. Although this is encouraging news,\nit usually comes with the negative side of more false transactions [1]. The banking\nand finance industry deals with uncommon challenges as fraud and risk management\nbecome more complicated in a digital environment.\nUsually rule-based systems, typical fraud detection techniques sometimes give up\nbecause they cannot change to fit transforming deceptive schemes [2]. Often utiliz-\ning static models and historical data, specific fraud detection and risk management\nmethods are substituted with AI-driven systems with real-time analysis and predic-\ntive responsibilities. Rising as game-changing technologies with great tools for fraud\ndetection and risk assessment were artificial intelligence (AI) and ML. Bringing pre-\ndictive analytics with AI into financial services is a significant step toward better risk\nmanagementandfraudprevention.AI-poweredsystemscanquicklyprocessenormous\nvolumes of data, spot trends, and highly precisely find anomalies[3] [4].\nTrained on historical transaction data, several ML models including XGBoost,\nRandom Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nandArtificialNeuralNetwork(ANN)identifyfrauddevelopments.Severalmodelsare\nprovided on labeled historical transaction data to detect patterns dividing real and\nfaketransactions.XGBoosteffectivelycombinesseveralmodelstoenhancepredictions;\nit is consequently capable of identifying intricate fraud patterns [5]. Although it can\nbe slow for real-time use, SVM sets apart legal and fraud by establishing a boundary.\nWhile it can be slow with massive quantities of data, KNN classifies transactions\nrelying on a connection to others [6]. ANN provides great accuracy but requires more\nexcellent computer capability by learning patterns in data using several layers [7].\nBeyondallofthese,theRFistheindicatedmodelduetoitsInterpretation,signifi-\ncantaccuracy,andresiliency.Gettingtransactionssentthroughthetrainedmodelsin\nreal time, where each model uses acquired information to identify whether the trans-\naction is genuine or a fraud. Considered an ensemble of decision trees, RF builds up\nseveral forecasts to provide substantial detection accuracy.\n2This research consequently has several limitations. XGBoost can be computation-\nallyexpensiveformassivedatasetsandrequirescarefultuningeventhoughitispretty\naccurate. High-dimensional data presents difficulties for SVM, which causes it to lose\nefficiencyforreal-timefrauddetection.KNNcompareseverytransactionwithallpast\nones,soitisslowformassivedatasets.AlthoughANNoffersexcellentaccuracy,real-\ntime processing is complex since it demands significant volumes of training data and\ngreat computational resources.\nThis research contributes the following key contributions:\n\u2022 This article offers a real-time fraud detection system that produces few false posi-\ntives that accurately recognizes fraudulent transactions, consequently guaranteeing\nimproved financial system security.\n\u2022 Comparatively analyzing several ML models (RF, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, and\nANN), the work suggests that RF is best suited for real-time fraud prevention and\npossesses the highest detection accuracy (100%).\n\u2022 Leveraging a dataset of more than 6 million transactions, the work confirms the\nscalability and resilience of ML models in managing biased data and identifying\nadvanced fraud decisions.\nThis paper\u2019s remaining sections are organized as follows: A thorough analysis of\nprevious research on AI-based financial market prediction is given in section 2. The\nmethodology is fully described in section 3, covering model design, optimization tech-\nniques,anddatapretreatment.Theexperimentalresultsareshowninsection4,which\ncomparesthemodel\u2019sperformancetothemostadvancedtechniques.Finally,section5\nconcludesbysummarizingthemainconclusionsandreviewingpossibleimprovements\nfor further studies, such as incorporating more advanced deep learning (DL) methods\nand real-time financial data processing.\n2 Literature Review\nResearch on multiple computing methodologies, such as rule-based systems, ML\nmodels, and DL approaches, has been implemented to improve automated financial\ntransaction systems.\nJohoraetal.[8]demonstratedthelimitsofconventionalfrauddetectiontechniques\nand rising cybersecurity risks in banking. It underlines how well logistic regression\nand DT are two examples of AI and ML algorithms that improve fraud detection\naccuracy. Experiments demonstrate that AI models have great accuracy; logistic\nregression performs best at 98%, so providing enhanced security in financial trans-\nactions. Additionally, primary concerns, though, were data imbalance and algorithm\ntransparency.\nLikewise, Ismaeil et al.[9] examining the development of fraud detection from con-\nventional rule-based approaches to AI-driven solutions. It emphasized how well ML\nandDLapproachesidentifyintricatefraudpatterns,lowerfalsepositives,andprovide\nreal-time fraud protection. With models achieving accuracy rates as high as 98%, the\nstudy highlighted the part AI plays in adjusting to new fraud tendencies.\n3Kotha et al.[10] emphasized ML, DL, and NLP, observing the shift from con-\nventional rule-based fraud detection to AI-driven methodologies. AI algorithms show\nbetter accuracy in recognizing fraud by finding irregularities in financial transactions\nsometimes overlooked by more traditional techniques. Studies demonstrate that AI-\ndriven fraud detection systems reach great accuracy up to 98% while also being very\nsensitive. Despite data privacy and system integration issues, AI keeps transforming\nfraud prevention to guarantee improved security and efficiency in the financial sector.\nRani et al.[11] demonstrated how rule-based fraud detection systems have tran-\nsitioned to AI-driven solutions in modern banking, an exploration of AI-Driven\napproaches for enhanced fraud prevention, risk management, and regulatory compli-\nance deals with appears. As the main AI tools for increasing risk management and\nfraud prevention, it demonstrates graph analytics, NLP, and deep learning. With AI\nmodels reaching up to 98% accuracy, the study noted great fraud detection capacity.\nDespite this, issues such as data security, AI bias, and regulatory compliance will be\ntheir top concern for financial institutions.\nFurthermore, Khare et al.[1] investigated several ML methods for digital transac-\ntion fraud detection, showing how well supervised learning models\u2014including logistic\nregression,RF,anddecisiontrees\u2014workinspottingfraudulentbehavior.Witha99%\naccuracy level, the DT model turned out to be the most successful approach among\nthe other models according to the research. Still, significant areas of additional inves-\ntigation are class imbalance, data preparation, and the necessity of enhanced DL\nmethods.\nAdditionally, Marripudugala et al.[12] examined how ML, DL, and NLP AI-\npowered technologies\u2014improve banking transaction efficiency and fraud detection.\nAccordingtothefindings,AI-drivenfrauddetectionsystemscanmoreaccuratelyrec-\nognizecomplicatedfraudulentdevelopmentsthanconventionalrule-basedapproaches.\nResults showed that up to 98% of ML models detect fraud, lowering false positives\nand improving real-time risk management. Still, financial institutions\u2019 top concerns\nremain data reliance, regulatory compliance, and AI model biases.\nBello et al.[13] looked at changing from conventional fraud detection strategies\nto AI-based solutions. They demonstrate how well anomaly detection, DL, and ML\nidentify criminal activity more efficiently and accurately. The study notes that Gra-\ndient Boosting Machines (GBM) significantly lower false positives by attaining the\nbest accuracy of 95%. Nevertheless, implementing AI-driven fraud detection in real-\ntime financial transactions depends on data quality, security concerns, and regulatory\ncompliance.\nLimitations and Difficulties with Stock Price Prediction Models Found:\n\u2022 Unlike genuine transactions, fraudulent ones are rarely generated and generate\nimbalanced datasets that could skew models toward non-fraudulent scenarios.\n\u2022 The constant evolution of their approaches enables fraudsters to maybe avoid\ndetection systems based on their fraudulent movements.\n\u2022 Real-timehandlingofenormoustransactiondatademandsefficientsystemsandcan\npresent challenges with execution.\n\u2022 Complex models would overfit the training data, thus decreasing their ability to\ngeneralize to unresolved fraud patterns.\n43 Methodology\nIn this section, we briefly discuss our overall research methodology on fraud detection\nin real-time financial transactions, along with the dataset, and prepare the data and\nrelevant techniques. We employ several AI models, including XGBoost, RF, SVM,\nKNN and ANN. Figure 1 displays the overall research methodology.\nFig. 1: Graphical Representation of the Overall Research Methodology\n3.1 Dataset Description\nIn this study, we fetched the fraud dataset from Kaggle comprising 6,353,307 trans-\nactions, each with 11 features, designed to simulate and detect fraudulent activities\nin financial transactions. The data spans 744 time steps, each representing one hour\nover 30 days. The key columns include \u2019step,\u2019 which means the time unit, and \u2019type,\u2019\nwhich categorizes the transaction as CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT, or\nTRANSFER. The \u2019amount\u2019 column records the transaction value in local currency,\nwhile \u2019nameOrig\u2019 and \u2019nameDest\u2019 denote the sender and recipient, respectively. The\n\u2019oldbalanceOrg\u2019 and \u2019newbalanceOrig\u2019 capture the account balance before and after\nthe transaction for the sender, while \u2019oldbalanceDest\u2019 and \u2019newbalanceDest\u2019 track the\nsamefortherecipient,withsomerecordslackingrecipientinformationfortransactions\ninvolving merchants. The \u2019isFraud\u2019 column indicates whether a transaction is fraudu-\nlent,while\u2019isFlaggedFraud\u2019flagsanattempttotransfermorethan200,000inasingle\ntransaction as potential fraud. Where, 0 indicates a legitimate transaction, while 1\nrepresents fraud. Figure 2 exhibits the correlation matrix of the dataset\u2019s features.\n3.2 Data Preprocessing\nIn this study, we employ various data pre-processing techniques to improve the qual-\nity of the data set and provide a robust fraud detection model. The missing values\nwere initially addressed, as the data set contained explicit null values. The average\nimputation method was applied to impute these missing values:\nn\n1 (cid:88)\nX = X (1)\nimputed n i\ni=1\n5Fig. 2: The correlation matrix of the dataset\u2019s features\nwhere X represents the imputed value, and X denotes the observed values.\nimputed i\nOutlier removal was performed using the Z-score and interquartile range (IQR)\nmethods.TransactionswithZ-scoresbeyond\u00b13wereconsideredoutliersandremoved.\nThe Z-score was computed as:\nx\u2212\u00b5\nZ = (2)\n\u03c3\nwhereZ istheZ-score,xisthedeterminedvalue,\u00b5isthemean,and\u03c3 isthestandard\ndeviation.\nFor the IQR-based outlier removal, the following equations were used:\nIQR=Q \u2212Q (3)\n3 1\nLower Bound=Q \u22121.5\u00d7IQR, Upper Bound=Q +1.5\u00d7IQR (4)\n1 3\nIn this case, the first and third quartiles are denoted by Q and Q .\n1 3\nTo enable numerical processing, categorical attributes were transformed. The type\nfeature was encoded using label encoding:\nX =f(X ) (5)\nencoded categorical\nwhere X represents the categorical feature, and f denotes the encoding\ncategorical\nfunction.\nAdditionally, irrelevant features such as nameOrig, nameDest, and isFlaggedFraud\nwere dropped, as they provided minimal contribution to fraud detection.\nMulticollinearity was assessed using Pearson correlation analysis and Variance\nInflationFactor(VIF)calculations.TheVIFforeachfeaturewascomputedasfollows:\n1\nVIF = (6)\ni 1\u2212R2\ni\nwhere R2 is the coefficient of determination from a regression model predicting the\ni\nith feature using all other independent features.\n6Table 1: Random Forest Model\u2019s Hyperparameters for Real-Time Fraud Detection\nHyperparameter Description\nn estimators 100\nmax features sqrt\nmin samples leaf 5\nn jobs -1\nrandom state 42\noob score false\n3.3 Classification\nOur fraud detection model employs several AI techniques, including XGboost, SVM,\nRF,KNN,andANN,whichexaminetransactionaldatatoidentifyfraudulentpatterns\ninreal-timetransactions.Bycombiningtheseseveralmethods,themodelreducesfalse\npositives and improves fraud detection effectiveness.\n3.3.1 Random Forest Classifier (RF)\nWeemployedtheRFClassifierforfrauddetectionduetoitsensemblelearningcapabil-\nity, which builds numerous DTs and aggregates their predictions to enhance accuracy\nwhile reducing overfitting [14]. Mathematically, each decision tree h (x) makes a pre-\nt\ndiction based on its learned decision function f (x). The final classification output is\nt\ndetermined through majority voting, where the predicted class y\u02c6is given by:\ny\u02c6=mode{h (x),h (x),...,h (x)} (7)\n1 2 T\nwhere,T denotesthetotalnumberoftrees.Thismethodreducestheriskofoverfitting,\neffectivelyhandlesnumericalandcategoricaldata,andensuresresilienceagainstnoise,\nmaking it a practical choice for fraud detection.\n3.3.2 XGboost\nBy reducing the loss function and avoiding overfitting, the potent gradient-boosting\nmethod XGBoost improves prediction accuracy [15]. The objective of this function is:\nn T\n(cid:88) (cid:88)\nL(\u03b8)= l(y ,y\u02c6)+ \u2126(f ) (8)\ni i t\ni=1 t=1\nwhere l(y ,y\u02c6) defines the loss function, and \u2126(f ) is the regularization term.\ni i t\nXGBoost\u2019sefficiency,scalability,andhandlingofimbalanceddatamakeitsuitablefor\nfraud detection.\n3.3.3 Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\nThe SVM is a supervised learning model employed for classification tasks [16],[17].\nIt finds the optimal hyperplane w\u00b7x+b = 0 that separates data points of different\n7classes with the largest margin. The optimization problem is:\n1\nmin \u2225w\u22252 (9)\nw,b 2\nsubject to the constraint:\ny (w\u00b7x +b)\u22651, \u2200i (10)\ni i\nwhere y is the label of the data point x . For non-linear data, SVM uses a kernel\ni i\nfunction \u03d5(x) to map the data into higher dimensions, allowing for linear separation.\nThe decision function is given by:\n(cid:32) N (cid:33)\n(cid:88)\nf(x)=sign \u03b1 y (x \u00b7x)+b (11)\ni i i\ni=1\n3.3.4 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\nAstraightforwardnon-parametricclassifier,theKNNalgorithmprovidesaclasslabel\nto a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature\nspace [18]. Given a test point x, the algorithm calculates the distance to all training\npoints and selects the k closest points.

The Euclidean distance between two points\nx =(x ,x ,...,x ) and x=(x ,x ,...,x ) is given by:\ni i1 i2 in 1 2 n\n(cid:118)\n(cid:117) n\n(cid:117)(cid:88)\nd(x i,x)=(cid:116) (x\nij\n\u2212x j)2 (12)\nj=1\nAfter calculating the distances, the algorithm selects the k nearest neighbors and\nclassifies x based on the majority vote of those neighbors:\ny\u02c6=mode{y ,y ,...,y } (13)\n1 2 k\nwhere y ,y ,...,y are the class labels of the nearest neighbors.\n1 2 k\n3.3.5 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\nAn ANN computes the output a of each neuron in the hidden layers as a weighted\ni\nsum of inputs, followed by an activation function f:\n(cid:32) n (cid:33)\n(cid:88)\na =f w x +b (14)\ni ij j i\nj=1\nTo reduce the loss, the weights are changed during network training.\n84 Result and Analysis\nThissectionpresentsthemodelperformanceevaluationmetrics,real-timeadaptation,\nand experimental setup. The models\u2019 results are examined, and a comparison with\ncurrent methods is presented. The outcomes demonstrate our model\u2019s exceptional\naccuracy and handling of big datasets and real-world situations.\n4.1 Experimental Setup\nInourresearch,weuseseveralMLmodelsforreal-timefrauddetection;amongthem,\nRFisthebestmodelconfiguredwith100trees,amaximumdepthof10,andtheGini\nindex as the splitting criterion. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested\non 20%, using a batch size of 64 transactions. We perform 5-fold cross-validation to\nensure generalizability and train for 3000 iterations. The hyperparameters of the RF\nmodel, such as the number of estimators, maximum features for splitting, minimum\nsamplesperleaf,andparallelizationoptions,arecarefullytunedtoenhancepredictive\naccuracy,reduceoverfitting,andoptimizecomputationalefficiencyforreal-timefraud\ndetection,whichispresentedinTable1.HardwareresourcesincludeaTeslaK80GPU\nwith 2496 CUDA cores and 12 GB of VRAM, a 2.3 GHz Xeon CPU, 12 GB of RAM,\nand 2 GB of disk space. Key software tools include numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow\n(with Keras), and pandas for efficient model implementation and data handling.\n4.2 Real-Time Adaptation\nInourfrauddetectionframework,real-timeadaptationisachievedthroughadynamic\nML approach that continuously updates its model parameters based on incoming\ntransaction data. Each transaction is characterized by a feature set X at time t,\nt\nwhichincludestransactionhistory,userbehavior,andexternalthreatintelligence.The\nfraud detection model processes these features to classify transactions as fraudulent\nor legitimate.\nTo improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives, we employ an adaptive\nlearning mechanism that refines the classification model over time. Given an initial\ndecision function f(X ), model updates are driven by error minimization:\nt\n\u03b8 =\u03b8 \u2212\u03b7\u2207L(f(X ),y ), (15)\nt+1 t t t\nwhere \u03b8 denotes the model parameters, \u03b7 is the learning rate, and L(f(X ),y )\nt t t\nrepresents the loss function according to classification errors. The model constantly\nmodifies its decision boundaries to adapt to growing fraud patterns.\nWe incorporate an ensemble-based technique, in which several models influence\nthe final decision, to improve real-time adaptation further:\nN\n(cid:88)\nF(X)= w f (X), (16)\ni i\ni=1\nwherew meanstheweightallocatedtoeachmodelf (X).Thisapproachleverages\ni i\nmodel diversity, decreasing sensitivity to distribution shifts in transaction data.\n94.3 Evaluation Metrics\nThisexperimentusedseveralwell-knownevaluationmetricstoassesstheperformance\nof the suggested ML models.

Methods\nThis study uses the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory\n(LSTM), which are two powerful and advantageous deep learning algorithms.\n3.3.1. Recurrent Neural Network\nThe recurrent neural network (RNN) is one of the currently most popular deep learn-\ning network structures and is often used for processing data with a sequential nature.\nRNN is good at capturing the relations between each data point and can produce predic-\ntions on sequential data with higher accuracy. Important information from the past is pre-\nserved in the modeling process as the input variable to be computed with current data.\nThe computing architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. The computing result of the tth data\nwill be in a hidden state as the input variable. This input variable and the t + 1 data will\nbe introduced into the hidden layer together for computation. The activation function\nused in the hidden layer of the recurrent neural network is a hyperbolic tangent function\n(tanh). This is expressed in Equation (1) below.\n(1)\n(cid:2207)\u2032 =(cid:1820)(cid:1801)(cid:1814)(cid:1808)( (cid:2205) (cid:2207)(cid:4593) +(cid:2205) (cid:2206) +(cid:2184) )\n(cid:2202) (cid:2190)(cid:2202) (cid:2202)(cid:2879)(cid:2778) (cid:2206)(cid:2202) (cid:2202) (cid:2202)\nThe RNN is usually used for the description of temporal dynamic behavior se-\nquences.

Discussion\nRNN and LSTM are two popular and representative deep learning algorithms. LSTM\naddresses the possible poor performance of long-term memory of RNN models. LSTM is\ninnovative for the addition of three steps (i.e., forget, update, and input) in the neurons,\nso as to dramatically enhance long-term memory performance. Both RNN and LSTM can\nquickly and effectively process large data volumes and establish models. They both have\ngood capabilities in learning, optimization, and prediction (detection). In addition, vali-\ndation is important to modeling.\nThis study adopts a number of measures to ensure model validity as follows. (1) The\nraw data are normalized and standardized so that all the data values are between 0 and\n1. (2) Random sampling is performed and data are not placed back to the pool, in order to\navoid bias due to repeated data. (3) Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), the optimizer\nbuilt-in TensorFlow, is used to adjust the optimal parameters. (4) Multiple performance\nmetrics are referenced to evaluate the model performance.\nThis paper selects a total of 18 variables frequently used to measure financial state-\nment fraud. They consist of 14 financial variables and 4 non-financial variables (also\nknown as corporate governance variables). RNN and LSTM are used for deep learning\nand optimization to establish an optimal model. The modeling process starts with a ran-\ndom sampling of 60% of the data as the training dataset. The parameters in the dataset are\nfitted in the learning process, and the best prediction model is derived with constant op-\ntimization. The validation dataset is sampled randomly from 15% of the total data, for the\nvalidation of the status and convergence with stable accuracy. Hyper-parameters are ad-\njusted to avoid overfitting. The remaining 25% of the data is used as the test dataset, to\nassess the generalization and detection capability of the model (i.e., the performance of\nthe model).\nThe empirical results indicate that the test dataset in the LSTM model boasts a detec-\ntion accuracy of 94.88%, or better than that of the RNN test dataset at 87.18%. Both models\nproduce an accuracy rate higher than 85%. These are great results in social science [10,11].\nAs far as error rates are concerned, Type I error rate and Type II error rate of the LSTM\nmodel are both 2.56%, or lower than Type I error rate of 5.13% and Type II error rate of\n7.69% for the RNN model. Type I error rate indicates the probability of predicting fraudSustainability2021,13,9879 14of20\n5. Discussion\nRNNandLSTMaretwopopularandrepresentativedeeplearningalgorithms.

The credit mechanism of the capital market is seriously frustrated, and investors have\nsuffered huge economic losses. In this paper, luckin coffee as an example, from the five aspects of theory\nof fraud risk factors, through the representation of luckin coffee financial fraud, analyzes the internal\ncauses of its fraud. Through the case study, it is found that the occurrence of financial fraud in luckin\ncoffee is the result of internal and external factors. On the one hand, it has sounded the alarm for the\nstandardized operation of new retail enterprises in China, and on the other hand, it has provided\nenlightenment for the country to improve relevant laws and regulations and strengthen the cost of fraud\npunishment.\nKeywords: Theory of fraud risk factors; Financial fraud; Motivation\n1. Introduction\nFinancial fraud refers to the premeditated and deliberate use of deceptive means and illegal behaviors\nby enterprise groups or individuals to obtain improper interests. Since the beginning of the 21st century,\nEnron Corporation and other companies broke out in the international financial fraud events, and\ndomestic also exposed many listed companies financial fraud problems. Financial fraud has become a\nstubborn disease of listed companies, the capital market is experiencing an unprecedented \"credit crisis\",\nand financial fraud seems to become the main culprit of this \"credit crisis\".\nThis paper will take luckin coffee as an example, starting from the five elements of the theory of fraud\nrisk factors, analyze the reasons for its financial fraud from five aspects of moral quality, motivation,\nopportunity and exposure possibility, and punishment degree, in order to provide beneficial\nenlightenment for the improvement of the company's internal governance and the optimization of the\nexternal regulatory environment.\n2. Case Background\n2.1. Introduction of luckin coffee\nLuckin coffee was founded in 2017.Since July 2018, luckin has completed several rounds of financing,\nincluding round A and round B. In April 2019, luckin submitted the prospectus document and was\nofficially listed on NASDAQ on May 17.\nLuckin coffee mainly deals in beverage and food series and is the largest chain coffee brand in China.\nSince its establishment, luckin coffee has exploited the rapidly developing big data platform to explore\na new model of online retail. At the same time, it also carries out in-depth cooperation with major\nsuppliers. In January 2018, it launched trial operation in 13 cities including Beijing and Shanghai. By\nMay 2018, 525 stores have been completed. After it went public, its share price soared, peaking at $50.02\nper share.\n2.2. Review of luckin Coffee fraud\nMuddy Waters Research, one of the famous short sellers, forwarded dozens of pages of anonymous\nshort selling report in early 2020, pointing out luckin coffee's financial fraud, business model defects and\nother signals. It caused a great sensation in the capital market, causing luckin's stock price to drop by\nPublished by Francis Academic Press, UK\n-37-Academic Journal of Business & Management\nISSN 2616-5902 Vol. 3, Issue 11: 37-41, DOI: 10.25236/AJBM.2021.031107\nmore than 24% in a single day, and closed down 10.47%.\nIn April 2020, luckin coffee reported false transactions from the second quarter to the fourth quarter\nof 2019, resulting in an inflated revenue of 2.2 billion yuan. According to the official investigation, luckin\ncoffee has forged transaction records since April 2019, falsely increasing its 2019 revenue by nearly 2.2\nbillion yuan and its costs and expenses by more than 1.3 billion yuan. In September 2020, the State\nAdministration for Market Regulation imposed an administrative penalty on luckin coffee (China) Co.,\nLtd. for its illegal acts of unfair competition, and fined luckin 2 million yuan.\n3. Fraud case analysis of Luckin Coffee based on theory of fraud risk factors\n3.1. Moral quality analysis\nLuckin's chairman and largest shareholder, Lu Zhengyao, founded China Auto Rental(CAR) before\nluckin. At that time, CAR occupied the market by burning money to fight price war in the early stage,\nborrowing financing and then listing dividends to cash out, a series of operations, so that the majority of\ninvestors suffered huge losses. But by comparison, the original investors in CAR earned a 380% return.\nIn addition, Qian Zhiya, Li Hui and Liu Erhai, who co-founded luckin coffee with Lu Zhengyao, were\nall from CAR.A comparison of the board members and major investors of luckin and CAR reveals a\nsimilar composition. Then luckin coffee financial fraud incident, it is not difficult to connect with the\nlack of moral quality of the company's managers.\n3.2. Motivation factor analysis\n3.2.1. Financing needs of the company\nSince its inception, luckin coffee has grown rapidly with the goal of becoming the \u201cStarbucks\u201d of\nChina. Through a series of bombing publicity, issuing a large number of coupons and various promotional\nand discount activities, luckin has been wildly sought after by consumers in the consumer market for a\nperiod of time. However, the income from the low-end products and services created by luckin from the\nvery beginning is not enough to support the capital costs consumed under its current business model. As\ncan be seen from Table 1, luckin coffee's net cash flow from operating activities has been negative for\nmore than one year since the second quarter of 2018, while its net cash flow from financing activities has\nbeen basically positive. So luckin, which is expected by investors to continue its expansion plans, still\nneeds continued financing. Therefore, in order to achieve the goal of presenting good performance and\nattracting financing, the management of luckin finally whitewashing the financial statements by means\nof falsely increasing income and related party transactions.\nTable 1: Luckin coffee cash flow analysis unit: 100 million yuan.\nFinancial indicators 2018.06 2018.09 2018.12 2019.03 2019.03 2019.03\nNet cash flows from 0.3 1.05 0.39 0.94 0.54 0.17\noperating activities\nNet cash flows from 0.22 1.89 0.49 0.11 3.43 0.96\ninvesting activities\nNet cash flows from 2.03 1.56 2.08 0.13 8.07 0.22\nfinancing activities\nData source: luckin coffee 2018 and 2019 financial reports\n3.2.2. Avoid the need to be regulated\nIn general, large fluctuations in the performance of listed companies will attract the attention of\nregulators, but for those listed companies with relatively stable performance, attention is obviously not\nenough. Therefore, in order to avoid attracting the attention of regulators, listed companies will try to\nmaintain their performance at a relatively stable level, which may reduce the vigilance of regulators and\nthus reduce the possibility of being investigated. Therefore, listed companies are often out of the need to\navoid alerting regulators, and financial fraud. Luckin coffee is an emerging enterprise with a very short\ngrowth period and rapid development. If its business performance changes too much at this time, it is\nvery likely to attract the attention of the regulatory authorities, which will hinder its business expansion\nplan. So, to avoid attracting regulatory attention, luckin chose to create the illusion of a healthy business\nby dressing up its financial statements.\nPublished by Francis Academic Press, UK\n-38-Academic Journal of Business & Management\nISSN 2616-5902 Vol. 3, Issue 11: 37-41, DOI: 10.25236/AJBM.2021.031107\n3.3. Opportunity analysis\n3.3.1. Unreasonable ownership structure\nLuckin coffee's shareholding structure has a significant proportion of one person. According to Figure\n1, Lu Zhengyao holds the largest share, followed by Qian Zhiya, the other founder, while Lu's sister holds\nthe third largest share after Qian Zhiya. The combined control of the top three shareholders is 62.55%,\nwhich is enough to control the major decision-making power of luckin coffee. Luckin coffee's overly\ncentralized and unreasonable holding structure makes it unable to form effective constraints in internal\ndecision-making. Lu Zhengyao, the former chairman of CAR, also took luckin under his own control,\nthe company's management structure has no practical usefulness. The excessive concentration of control\nprovided opportunities for luckin coffee to commit financial fraud.\n18.80%\n30.53%\n6.75%\n11.90%\n19.68%\n12.34%\nLu Zhengyao Qian Zhiya Lu's sister Li Hui Liu Erhai others\nFigure 1: shareholding ratio\nSource: luckin coffee's 2020 prospectus\n3.3.2. Weak external supervision\n(1) From the perspective of government supervision, luckin coffee, as a new enterprise, has been\nlisted for a short time; Secondly, luckin coffee chose to be listed in the United States, while operating in\nChina. Therefore, the above two points have obstructed the effective supervision and review by the\nregulatory authorities.\n(2) From the perspective of investors, many domestic investors have some difficulties in obtaining\ncomplete and effective relevant financial information due to the difference between the place of business\nand the place of listing. The majority of investors are very easy to receive the wrong information of their\nmodified appearance of good operation, which also weakens the supervision role of the public\nparticipating in investment.\n(3) From the perspective of the industry, luckin coffee, as a new retail enterprise making full use of\nbig data platform, may no longer be applicable to some traditional audit supervision methods. So it gives\nthem the opportunity to commit financial fraud when regulatory approaches may lag behind those of\nemerging industries.\n3.4. Exposure possibility analysis\nLuckin coffee is mainly operated in China, but registered and listed in the United States, so there is a\ncertain information difference between the place of operation and the place of listing. As a result, it is\ndifficult for foreign regulatory agencies to grasp the business situation of luckin in a timely manner, and\ntheir jurisdiction is difficult to play an effective role. At the same time, domestic investors may not be\nable to obtain the financial reports and other data disclosed by luckin abroad in the first time, which may\ncause certain information lag or error. Based on the above reasons, it makes it more difficult for regulators\nand investors to supervise luckin, thus reducing the probability of its fraud exposure and providing the\npossibility for its later fraud.\nPublished by Francis Academic Press, UK\n-39-Academic Journal of Business & Management\nISSN 2616-5902 Vol. 3, Issue 11: 37-41, DOI: 10.25236/AJBM.2021.031107\n3.5. Degree of punishment analysis\nBefore the implementation of the new Securities Law on March 1, 2020, China's Securities\nRegulatory Commission will impose a maximum fine of 600,000 yuan on the fraudulent behavior of\nlisted companies, which is of low illegal cost. Many companies through fraud gains much higher than\nthe amount of punishment for fraud, so listed companies to profit by financial fraud means. In the\nfinancial fraud case of luckin coffee, China's Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) only imposed\na fine of 100,000 yuan on Lu Zhengyao, the main fraudster of luckin Coffee, which was far less than the\nbenefits from the fraud. Therefore, the financial fraud did not form a huge deterrent force, which also led\nto the listed company's financial fraud repeatedly.\n4. Conclusion and enlightenment\n4.1. Research conclusions\nDuring the decades since the establishment of China's securities market, financial fraud has occurred\nrepeatedly. With the continuous development of China's securities market, listed companies fraud\nproblem is becoming more and more intense, the development and progress of emerging industries, but\nalso makes all kinds of fraud means more and more complex, more and more hidden. In this background,\nthis article takes luckin coffee as an example, from the five elements of theory of fraud risk factors,\nthrough the presentation of financial fraud, luckin coffee analyses the inner factors of the fraud, research\nconclusions are as follows: (1) in terms of moral quality, luckin coffee mainly are greatly influenced by\nthe major shareholders, management, lead to the existence of serious potential risk for fraud.(2) In terms\nof motivation, luckin coffee is in urgent need of financing and is under pressure to avoid supervision,\nthus prompting its fraudulent behavior. (3) In terms of opportunity factors, the unreasonable shareholding\nstructure of luckin Coffee and the loopholes of external supervision give the management the opportunity\nto commit financial fraud.(4) In terms of the possibility of exposure, luckin coffee benefited from the\ninformation difference between the place of supervision and the place of operation, which greatly reduced\nthe possibility of being exposed to financial fraud and made luckin coffee have fluke mentality.(5) In\nterms of the degree of punishment, China's Securities Regulatory Commission only imposed a fine of\n100,000 yuan on Lu Zhengyao, the main fraudster. Such a small penalty, but also did not make the\nimplementation of financial fraud people fear.\n4.2. Research enlightenment\nAccording to the five factors of luckin coffee's motivation for financial fraud, this paper puts forward\nsuggestions on preventing financial fraud from three aspects: optimizing the corporate structure,\nstrengthening external supervision and increasing the cost of fraud.\n4.2.1. Optimize the company structure\n(1) Improve the corporate governance structure.\nThe unreasonable shareholding structure of luckin coffee is an important reason for its financial fraud.\nChairman Lu Zhengyao not only owns the largest shareholding, but also basically controls the\nmanagement and decision-making power of luckin coffee. Therefore, the internal management right and\nownership of the company should be strictly separated, and the supervisory function of the board of\nsupervisors should be strengthened, so that the power of the company's top management can be\neffectively checked. Optimizing corporate governance structure can also maintain the organization\noperation of the company more effectively and prevent its financial fraud.\n(2) Strengthen the internal audit function.\nLuckin coffee as a new retail enterprise with rapid development momentum, its internal audit is\nrelatively weak. Therefore, for this kind of emerging enterprises, the supervision function of internal\naudit should be strengthened. First of all, in the face of its sales characteristics different from traditional\nenterprises, more specific and scientific rules of internal control system should be formulated. Secondly,\nindependent directors should be strictly selected and their supervisory role should be reasonably used. In\naddition, the internal audit committee may be composed of independent directors to be responsible for\nthe selection and entrustment of firms required by external audit, which can not only maintain the\nindependence of internal audit, but also avoid the collusion between company management and\naccounting firms.\nPublished by Francis Academic Press, UK\n-40-Academic Journal of Business & Management\nISSN 2616-5902 Vol. 3, Issue 11: 37-41, DOI: 10.25236/AJBM.2021.031107\n4.2.2. Strengthen external supervision\n(1) Improving laws and regulations\nFaced with problems such as the difficulty of new retail enterprises like luckin coffee in auditing and\nthe lag of relevant laws, specific laws and regulations related to emerging industries should be updated\nin a timely manner to provide a reference basis for market supervision.\n(2) Strengthening supervision in other places\nThrough the study of this case, it can be found that due to the difference in information acquisition\nbetween Chinese and overseas regulatory authorities, enterprises like luckin coffee seize the opportunity\nto cheat. Therefore, in view of this situation, we should strengthen the contact between China and\noverseas regulatory agencies, expand the scope of supervision, timely exchange of information, and\nprevent the difficulty of remote supervision caused by information occlusion.\n4.2.3. Increase the cost of fraud\nThrough the analysis of luckin company, it can be found that the earnings obtained through financial\nfraud are far higher than the punishment. Mr Lu and others, who used to work for CAR, are unfazed by\nthe CSRC's punishment. Therefore, in view of this situation, China should increase the amount of\nfinancial fraud penalty, and relate the amount of the penalty to things like the company's price-to-earnings\nratio, in order to prevent the actual controller profit while minority shareholders pay the bill. In addition,\nheavier punishment can be imposed on those responsible for financial fraud, such as increasing the\ncriminal responsibility of managers who commit serious financial fraud. Through the above methods to\nincrease fraud cost to restrain the financial fraud of listed companies.\nReferences\n[1] Beasley,M.,J. Carcello,D. Hermanson,P.D.

Machine learning algorithms facilitate effective predictive\nmodels for fraud detection for Industry 4.0. This study aims to identify an efficient and stable model for fraud\ndetection platforms to be adapted for Industry 4.0. By leveraging a real credit card transaction dataset, this study\nproposes and compares five different learning models: logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors,\nrandom forest, and autoencoder. Results show that random forest and logistic regression outperform the other\nalgorithms. Besides, the undersampling method and feature reduction using principal component analysis could\nenhance the results of the proposed models. The outcomes of the studies positively ascertain the effectiveness of\nusing features selection and sampling methods for tackling business problems in the new age of digital economy\nand industrial 4.0 to detect fraudulent activities.\nKeywords: digital payment; fraud detection; machine learning; Industry 4.0; cybersecurity for Industry 4.0\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIndustry 4.0 has facilitated the rise of e-commerce, leading to the proliferation of digital payment [1].\nPhysical and IoT devices are connected with digital systems in Industry 4.0, allowing for better collaboration\nacross the ecosystem, enhancing processes, and driving growth [2]. More and more enterprises and industries take\ninto account this new industrial revolution. Unfortunately, keeping pace with this growth, the cybercrime rate in\n1digital payments is not far behind. Indeed, significant monetary losses every year due to the growing trend of\nfraudulent transactions urge the financial industry to improve fraud detection systems continuously. There are\nseveral control steps in a typical fraud detection process, each of which can either be managed by humans or\nautomated. Unfortunately, the detection is notoriously tricky and influenced by factors such as money and\ncustomer spending behaviors. Machine learning algorithms, a leading technological advance for Industry 4.0,\nhave presented promising solutions to tackle these problems by enabling providers to optimize their customer\ndatabase with real-time transaction details, automatically detecting fraud and verification methods [1, 2].\nOver the past decade, there have been extensive machine learning studies to detect fraudulent\ntransactions\u2014 one of the popular methods to classify payment transactions is to distinguish fraud using regular\nlabels in database training, also known as supervised learning. The popular methods in this field include k-nearest\nneighbors (KNN) [3], decision trees [4], logistic regression [5], and support vector machine (SVM) [6]. These\nlearning methods can either be applied separately or assemble models such as random forest to detect fraudulent\ntransactions [7]. The supervised approach utilizes labeled historical transactions to build a predictive fraud model,\nwhich returns the likelihood of any new activity being a fraud. Nevertheless, labeling is time-consuming, and not\nall labels are ready quickly for the learning design [8]. Therefore, there is a light of studies that applied anomaly\nidentification, known as unsupervised learning, to detect fraudulent transactions. This approach aims to\ndiscriminate the data pattern of transactions and interpret outliers as fraud. Hence, unseen fraudulent activities can\nbe recognized and do not depend on past labeled transactions. A study in [9] found that unsupervised learnings\ncould handle the skewness issues in this field and give high classification results. Autoencoder, an artificial neural\nnetwork, appears to be a compelling method in Industry 4.0\u2019s fraud detection in recent unsupervised deep learning\ndue to its excellent capability to analyze complex, real-time, and large-scale data [10].\nResearchers devote efforts to compare different learning models but mainly focus on the same categorical\nlearnings, such as different supervised learning method comparisons. However, little research has evaluated and\ncompared supervised and unsupervised learning models in the field [11]. This study addresses this gap by\nevaluating the ability to detect fraudulent patterns of different models ranging from supervised to unsupervised\nlearnings. We propose four supervised algorithms, namely logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest,\nand an unsupervised algorithm \u2013 autoencoder.\nFurthermore, identifying the best-fit algorithms is still a critical challenge for researchers in this field for\nseveral reasons. First, digital transactions are highly imbalanced with small proportional fraudulent transactions,\nresulting in inaccurate performance evaluation. Next, finding suitable features, a crucial task to reduce redundant\n2and irrelevant features from the actual dataset, reducing training time, avoiding overfitting, and improving\nlearning performance are also concerns [12]. Thus, the effects of different sampling methods to solve skewed data\nand feature selection on the performance of the four proposed supervised learning models are also investigated in\nthis study. The dataset about European credit card holders\u2019 transactions [13] is applied to train and test our\nproposed model in terms of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curves (AUROC) and average precision.\nThis study proposes and evaluates machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions, which is a\nsignificant technical matter for financial providers in the Industry 4.0 era. The comparison comprises classification\napproaches and anomaly detection approach automatically recognizing and distinguishing unusual data from\nfinancial databases. By doing so, our contributions are fourfold. First, we contribute to this critical issue and\npresent practical learning algorithms that generate predictive fraud models adapted for financial business in\nIndustry 4.0. Second, our work represents the investigation of feature selection influence, a challenge and critical\nproblem affecting detecting fraud. Third, the imbalanced classification issue, a topic that is usually neglected in\nprevious comparative studies, is resolved in this study by applying more appropriate performance metrics and\naccessing different effects of oversampling and undersampling techniques. Hence, we can identify an efficient\nand stable model for fraud detection platforms in the age of Industry 4.0. Finally, this study applies a real\ntransactions dataset to analyze the performance of several learning algorithms to recognize fraudulent patterns.\nAlthough Industry 4.0 accelerates information transparency, there is a scarcity of real-world financial records to\nsupport the development of a fraud detection system due to confidentiality.\nOur findings are vital for gaining insights into the robustness of multiple learning techniques in detecting\ncredit card fraud in real-life circumstances. Likewise, as Industry 4.0 is still evolving and new forms of cybercrime\nand fraud keep emerging, our findings might help the association assemble a vastly enhanced fraud detection\nsystem for financial institutions and online payment providers that can better deal with the skewed data and\nemploy more reliable measurements to evaluate the results.\nThis paper is organized as follows. It starts with an introduction to the topic. The next section reviews\nrelevant studies in Industry 4.0, followed by the methodology section describing the applied methods and\nworkflow of our study. Section 4 presents the experiment and results of the fraud detection model. Finally, the\nfindings are discussed, and the implications are provided in Section 5.\nII. INDUSTRY 4.0\nIndustry 4.0, also referred to as the fourth industrial revolution, was first introduced in Germany in 2011\nand officially published in 2013 as a German strategic plan to improve production systems to boost national\n3business productivity and efficiency. Industry 4.0 draws a new industrial strategy by integrating the organizations\nto comprehensive technologies related to connectivity, digitalization, and automation [14]. The associated\ntechnologies comprise but are not limited to big data, data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of\nthings (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS). Industry 4.0\u2019s goals are to promote operational effectiveness and\nefficiency and achieve a greater level of automatization.\nIndustry 4.0 has an undeniable influence on almost every aspect of our daily lives, affecting and changing\nthe ways industries work and how individuals and organizations interact with technology. In particular, the digital\ntransformation has extensively impacted financial industries in the age of Industry 4.0, with a massive amount of\ndigital transactions undertaken every day. Technology advancement for Industry 4.0 has transformed traditional\nbanking into financial technology.\nBusiness works steadily rely on data, and with increasing hacking and unauthorized access, information\nsystems have become more vulnerable. Hence, cybersecurity has become an escalating challenge regarding the\ntop business risks and plays a leading role in maintaining business competitiveness within Industry 4.0 [15]. Fraud\ndetection is a prominent part of cybersecurity in the Industry 4.0 era [2]. Therefore, strengthening fraud detection\nsystems and cybersecurity efforts is essential for any financial institution or payment provider in the new digital\nage. Data science and AI play a significant role in improving cybersecurity, particularly in the digital payment\nfraud detection field. As a result, integrating data science and AI with industry 4.0 will assist financial institutions\nin increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of automated processes detecting and preventing fraudulent\nactivities.\nIII. METHODS\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was applied to explore and understand data. The flowchart of the data\nprocess is illustrated in Figure 1. First, the data was converted into a data frame during the preprocessing stage\nand checked for miss and duplicated values were. Then, data was prepared for training by normalizing features,\ndeleting unused columns, and getting a sample. Because this data was highly imbalanced, 5,000 transactions were\nrandomly re-sampled to make the training more efficient and save time. After that, sample data were split into\ntraining and test sets with a ratio of 80:20. Models were designed, then models were evaluated by training and test\nsets. A set of experiments have been conducted and compared using performance metrics such as AUROC and\nprecision. Other performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were also provided to support\nthe comparison.\n4Figure 1: Flowchart of the data process\nThis section explains the dataset adopted in the study and the five proposed algorithms, specifically\nlogistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest, and autoencoder. The following methods are also applied\nto the proposed model for supervised learning algorithms. First, the GridSearchCV method is applied with 5-fold\ncross-validation to tune and find the optimal hyperparameters and reduce overfitting. Then, Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) extracts features, while the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and Near\nMiss Undersampling methods reconstruct imbalanced training data into a balanced one. The autoencoder model\nis chosen for the unsupervised learning algorithm because of its ability to handle imbalanced data very well. It\ncan be trained using one class of data without the data labels. Different epochs and batch sizes are tried to find the\noptimal solution.\n1. Dataset Description\nThis study uses the dataset of September 2013 credit card transactions provided on Kaggle [13]. This\ndataset is widely used to test the proposed learning model by many studies [9], [16] to detect fraudulent\ntransactions. It comprised 284,807 transactions, of which 492 were fraudulent. Because of the confidentiality, the\nessential information and detailed features names about the dataset were not revealed. PCA was used to transform\nthe other 28 features except for the \u201cTime\u201d and \u201cAmount\u201d features. The \u201cTime\u201d feature was given by the seconds\nelapsed between the first transaction and the current transaction, while \u201cAmount\u201d is the money of the cardholder\u2019s\npurchase. Data was binary classified, and one corresponds to a fraudulent transaction, while zero is a regular one.\n2. Logistic Regression (LR)\nLogistic regression is used for the classification problem by gauging the outcome probability of a\nparticular class. The predictions are transformed using the logistic function, which returns probability values\nbetween 0 and 1. Logistic regression is widely applied for classification tasks [17] and widely adapted for Industry\n4.0 because it is easy to implement, has good accuracy, and is very efficient to train. Itoo et al. [5] indicated that\nlogistic regression achieved the best performance in fraud detection compared to Na\u00efve Bayes and KNN.\n5Different combinations of algorithms such as \u201cliblinear,\u201d \u201csag,\u201d and \u201clbfgs\u201d and regularisation strength\neffects (C values) were employed to find out the optimal method.\n\uf0b7 Lbfgs stands for Limited-memory Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno and is the defaulted solver in the\nSklearn Logistic Regression model. This solver used the inverse Hessian matrix, or second partial\nderivatives calculations, to update the gradient evaluations and discard earlier gradients, making the\ncomputation more effective and memory-saving.\n\uf0b7 Liblinear is a linear classification algorithm supporting logistic regression and is claimed to work well\nwith small datasets. It used a coordinate descent algorithm and successively performed approximate\nminimization along coordinate to optimize the problems.\n\uf0b7 Sag is Stochastic Average Gradient Descent and a breakthrough method in stochastic optimization that\nsignificantly reduced variance. It is an iterative technique to optimize the sum of a finite number of\nsmooth convex functions. Although this method is required to maintain the table of gradients and the\naverage gradient values, it is very efficient in terms of time and is usually applied for large datasets.\n\uf0b7 C measures the inverse power of the regularisation influence, i.e., the smaller the value of C is, the greater\nthe regularisation effect. There is a trade-off between low-bias and high-variance, so identifying the\nappropriate C value is critical to optimize the model. The C values of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 100 were used in\nthe model design.\n\uf0b7 L2 is named Ridge Regression and used as a regularizer. It adds the \u201csquared magnitude\u201d of coefficients\ndepending on the model complexity, so an additional component will be added to penalize the loss\nfunction.\nThe Ridge Regression (l2) can be obtained by maximizing the likelihood function with a penalized\nparameter applied to all the coefficients except the intercept. For a given i instance in an n observations dataset,\n\ud835\udc65 ,\ud835\udc66 are the feature input and output. The parameters to maximizing the log-likelihood function can be expressed\n\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc56\nas below\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc59(\ud835\udefd) = \u2211\ud835\udc66 log(\ud835\udf0b )+(1\u2212\ud835\udc66)log(1\u2212\ud835\udf0b )= \u2211[\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udefd\u2212log(1+ \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udefd) ]\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\nwhere, \u03b2 is the regression coefficients. The coefficients estimates are the values that maximize the\nfollowing slightly different log-likelihood function where a ridge penalty (l2) is added to the function. Then, the\nobjective function of the logistic regression algorithm can be written as\n6\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc59(\ud835\udefd) = \u2211[\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udefd\u2212log(1+ \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udefd) ]\u2212 \u03bb\u2211\ud835\udefd2\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57=1\nwhere, \u03bb is the hyperparameter and p is the weight of \u03b2. In other words, l2 regularization is a quadratic\nfunction of the weight values. By adding regularization, the model can be optimal and reduce overfitting.\n3. k-Nearest Neighbour Classifier (KNN)\nKNN is non-parametric and instance-based learning based on similarity measures and grouped based on\na similar manner. First, the distance between the current and input data points is calculated for every data point\nand is sorted in ascending order. Then, the prediction is composed by averaging the result, and k items with the\nsmallest distances are chosen. Finally, the most common class among the k nearest neighbors is assigned, and a\nmajority vote of its neighbors classifies the input data point. KNN is a classifier with only a proximate local\nfunction, and all its calculation is delayed until evaluating the model. The KNN algorithm is selected because it\ndoes not need any training for model generation, so its accuracy does not impact even new data added, suitable\nfor real-time fraudulent detection. A comparative study found that KNN performs better than other algorithms\nsuch as Na\u00efve Bayes to detect fraud on real-life payment transactions [3]. However, it might be costly in terms of\ntime and memory when working on an extensive dataset.\nIn this study, different metrics such as \u201cMinkowski,\u201d \u201cEuclidean,\u201d and \u201cManhattan,\u201d and parameter\ntuning for k from 2 to 7 are tried to find the optimal model.\n\uf0b7 \u201cEuclidean\u201d Distance is the shortest distance between two points and is measured as the square root\nof the total of the squared differences between two points. The distance can be expressed as\n\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66) = \u221a\u2211\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc66 )2\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\n\uf0b7 \u201cManhattan\u201d Distance is measured as the total of the absolute differences between two points, which\nis calculated as \ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66) =\u2211\ud835\udc5b |\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc66|\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\n\uf0b7 \u201cMinkowski\u201d Distance, a generalized form of the two above distance metrics, is computed as\n1\n\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc66) = (\u2211\ud835\udc5b |\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc5d)\ud835\udc5d , where p represents the order of the parameter.\n\ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\n4. Decision Tree (DT)\nA decision tree, one of the most widely used algorithms, is a non-parametric supervised learning, where\ndata is continuously divided based on a specific rule [18]. It builds in the form of a tree structure with a set of if-\nthen-else decision rules. It begins with a root node, a decision tree, splits into separate branches, connects with\nother nodes, and so on. The outcome is a tree with leaf nodes and decision nodes. Therefore, the decision tree can\nisolate a complicated issue into a simple one due to this tactical strategy of splitting and deciding. The significant\n7advantage of a decision tree is its interpretability and quickly draw insights from the modeling process flow by\ndepicting output visualization. Besides, the decision tree is fast and does not need much effort in data\npreprocessing like scaling data. Sahin and Duman [18] indicated that the decision tree model outperforms Support\nVector Machine (SVM) to solve fraud detection problems. However, the decision tree is easy to overfit if a small\nsample is used.\nFigure 2: Decision Tree diagram\nDifferent combinations of criterion functions such as \u201cGini\u201d and \u201cEntropy,\u201d the minimum number of splitting\nsamples from 2 to 7, and the maximum depth of the tree from 2 to 6 were used to find the best-fit model. The\nGini impurity (\u201cGini\u201d) and entropy are the functions to measure the quality of a split in the decision tree algorithm.\nPrecisely, the Gini impurity measures the frequency at which a specific node wrongly classifies the randomly\nchosen element and is defined as\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56 = 1\u2212 \u2211(\ud835\udc5d )2\n\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc56=1\nwhere N represents the total number of output classes in the set, and \ud835\udc5d represents the conditional probability that\n\ud835\udc56\nthe target variable is in class i in the set.\nEntropy indicates the randomness or the disorder of the features with the target and plays an essential role in\ncalculating Information Gain (IG). For each attribute, the entropy is computed using the below formula\n\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc66 = 1\u2212 \u2211\ud835\udc5d \u00d7log \ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc56 2 \ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc56=1\nThen IG can be measured based on entropy as \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3a = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61) \u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b). Like Gini\nimpurity, this measure is used to decide which feature to split on at each step in building the tree. IG favors smaller\n8partitions, while Gini usually favors larger partitions. Therefore, Gini impurity is calculated with less computation,\nand it is easy to implement in practice.\n5. Random Forest (RF)\nAs stated above, the decision tree is easy to overfit and sensitive to particular data [19]. Ensemble\nmethods can unravel these issues by combining predictions from multiple trees to make more accurate predictions\nthan a single one. Today, the random forest model is one of the most powerful ensemble models based on decision\ntrees and the bagging mechanism. Bagging refers to trained multiple decision trees on various subsamples of data\ncalled bootstrapping and then followed by aggregation. It grows various classification trees, such that for each\nbuilt tree, random data are run down the tree to compute the proximity for each pair of cases. As such, each tree\nin the forest is unique and has the same distribution. The random forest algorithm usually shows a great\ngeneralization as it aggregates different trees\u2019 decisions. Moreover, it also avoids the overfitting problem of\ncomplex decision trees. Furthermore, as each tree is built independently, random forest is computationally\nefficient and robust to outliers. Its application has been popular in recent years, especially in fraud detection,\nbecause it is easy to use and has high-performance results [20].\nDifferent combinations of criterion functions, such as \u201cGini\u201d and \u201cEntropy,\u201d the minimum number of\nsplitting samples from 2 to 7, and the maximum depth of the tree from 2 to 6 were used to find the best fit the\nrandom forest model.\n6. Autoencoder (AE)\nAE is deemed a compelling model in unsupervised learning for Industry 4.0. It is an exceptional neural\nnetwork architecture whose output is the same size as the input. An AE has two phases: an encoder generating a\ncompressed coding of the training data and a decoder reconstructing the given input, as illustrated in Figure 3.\nNormal data generally train AE for anomaly detection to obtain the reconstruction error (RE). RE is the difference\nvalue between the reconstructed and the initial variant. Normal data\u2019s RE is assumed to be more negligible as it\nis similar to the learning data, while the abnormal data one should be higher. Mean squared error (MSE) is applied\nin this study as RE and is computed as the following formula.\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc38 = 1\u2211\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc4c \u2212\ud835\udc4c\u0302)2 (2)\n\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56=1 \ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\nWhere n is the number of data points, and \ud835\udc4c and \ud835\udc4c\u0302 are observed and predicted values, respectively.\n\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\nAutoencoder was performed well on imbalanced data and outperformed LR in fraud detection [21].\nBesides, unlike supervised learning, it demonstrated the ability to detect fraudulent transactions without effort in\n9feature engineering, hence, saving time [22]. Therefore, this study proposed an Autoencoder model to evaluate its\nability to detect fraud by different batch sizes and learn rates.\nBoth encoder and decoder layers apply ReLU activation functions, lately rising activation function to\nreduce training loss and improve training time. In addition, L2, or Ridge regression, is applied as a regulariser to\navoid overfitting issues. Furthermore, Adam optimizer, an extension of Stochastic Gradient Descent, is selected\nin the model compile.\nFigure 3: Autoencoder Model\n7. Sampling\nThe synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is extensively discussed among the\noversampling method [23] and is widely applied to deal with skewness in fraud detection issues [20].\nOversampling adjusts the data to increase the number of minorities to balance with the majority. It over-samples\nthe minorities and creates synthetic samples using k-NN. Once the minority class sample x is selected amount k\nneighbor, the synthetic sample x generated by interpolating between \ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc65\u0303 is illustrated in Appendix 1 and\nnew\nfollow the formula (3):\n\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc65+\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51(0,1) \u00d7(\ud835\udc65\u0303 \u2212\ud835\udc65) (3)\n\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc64\nWhere rand(0,1) is a random number between 0 and 1\nSMOTE improves the model\u2019s reliability, convergence speed, accuracy, and efficiency [17]. However,\nthis approach had some implications, such as the potential overfitting issues, and the generated data might not\nresemble the initial data.\nUndersampling appears to mitigate the above oversampling issues. For this technique, the majority class\ninstances are randomly selected and added to the minority class with a 1:1 ratio. NearMiss is a popular\nundersampling technique to handle imbalanced data [24]. The example of how NearMiss works is presented in\n10Appendix 2. However, NearMiss could discard potentially helpful information essential for building rule\nclassifiers and introducing bias to the training set like other undersampling methods. Therefore, in many cases,\noversampling tends to yield better accuracy and is widely used in fraud detection.\n8. Feature extraction\nFeature extraction is performed to save computational resources and training time. Besides, it has been\nfound to avoid overfitting and potentially boost the algorithms\u2019 performance. Feature extraction is the approach\nwhere raw data is transformed into features while preserving the information in the original dataset. Principle\nComponent Analysis (PCA) is a widely applied feature extraction method in research for reducing the\ndimensionality of the data, optimizing the machine resources while minimizing information loss. The data\ndimensionality is reduced by creating new features from the existing dataset. PCA has been applied in many\nresearch domains, including machine learning and pattern recognition, for extracting optimal features [25].\nTherefore, it is applied in our study to investigate the feature extract effect on models\u2019 performance.\nAccording to Song et al. [25], PCA involves four following steps:\n- PCA\u2019s correlation/covariance matrix and the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed;\n- The eigenvectors V ,\u2026,V corresponding to the first n largest eigenvalues are selected ;\n1 n\n- The feature extraction result\u2019s contribution of the kth feature component is measured as follows:\n\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc50 = \u2211|\ud835\udc49 |\n\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udc56=1\n- The principal components c is selected and sorted in descending order.\nk\nBy doing so, a new dataset, constructed by transposing the eigenvectors and the initial data, is the cross-\nproduct of these two matrices. It decreases the number of features by generating a new and smaller number of\nfeatures that capture a substantial amount of the information in the original data.\nIV. DATA STRATEGY AND EXPERIMENTS\nThe study\u2019s data strategy included five stages: loading and preprocessing data, exploring data, preparing\ndata for learning model, training data, and evaluating results. Python 3.9 and its supported libraries were used for\ndata strategy, particularly NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization,\nand Sklearn and Tensorflow for machine learning. Five experiments were evaluated using AUROC and average\nprecision score to find the best performance model.\n1. Data loading and preprocessing\n11The credit card transaction dataset was downloaded on Kaggle and converted to a data frame for further\nprocessing. There was no missing value observed in this data; however, 1081 duplicated values were found and\nremoved.\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nThen, EDA was carried out to explore the data. There were more than 283,000 transactions in this dataset,\nand it was highly imbalanced with only 0.17% (473 transactions) fraud; hence, re-sample the data was\nrecommended to train efficiently. Data comprised 30 features, including Time, Amount, V1, to V28, which\ndistribution was visualized in Figure 4. Compared to the regular transactions, fraudulent transactions usually had\ndifferent distributions across most of the features in this dataset. Besides, Figure 5 illustrates that the transactions\u2019\namount in the case showing outliers and without outliers. It was observed that the amount feature was right-\nskewed, and regular transactions typically have lower amounts than fraudulent ones.\nFigure 4: Features distribution with feature name on the x-axis and density on the y-axis. The red color\npresented fraudulent transactions, and the blue color presented regular transactions.\n12Furthermore, the feature correlation analysis was performed to see the relationship between variables, as\ndisplayed in Figure 6. The intensity of the color shows the associated value of the relationship. Dark colors\nillustrated positive correlations, while brighter colors presented negative correlations. Except for Amount and V7\nfeatures, no highly-correlated variables were observed in this data.\nA B\nFigure 5: Fraudulent and regular transactions amount distribution including outliers (see A on the left) and\nexcluding outliers (see B on the right).\nFigure 6: Correlation matrix\n3. Data preparation for ML:\nA total of 5473 random samples were chosen, including 5,000 random regular transactions and all 473\nfraudulent transactions. \u201cRobustScaler\u201d normalized the \u201cAmount\u201d feature to avoid outliers according to the first\nand third quantile range and get a better model\u2019s generalization. This normalization could transform the instance\ni following the below formula:\n13\ud835\udc65 \u2212\ud835\udc44 (\ud835\udc65)\n\ud835\udc56 2\n\ud835\udc44 (\ud835\udc65)\u2212\ud835\udc44 (\ud835\udc65)\n3 1\nwhere Q ,Q , and Q represent the first, second, and third quartiles, respectively.\n1 2 3\nThen, the \u201cTime\u201d column was removed due to non-relevance. Once done, the new sample data was\nvisualized to check the distribution and feature correlation (Appendix 3,4). Then, sample data were split into train\nand test sets in a ratio of 80:20. Undersampling and oversampling techniques were employed to convert skewed\ntraining data to a balanced one for supervised learning models.\n4. Experiments:\nFive different experiments were designed to train and evaluate models. Different approaches were\napplied to tackle the challenges in fraud detection and improve classification performance. Four supervised\nlearning algorithms were used on the sample data in the baseline model (experiment 1), then adjusted the\nalgorithms with class weight to handle imbalanced data (experiment 2). Under-sampled and oversampled were\napplied to training data in experiments 3 and 4. All supervised models had used 5-fold cross-validation and tuned\nhyper-parameters by grid search (GridSearchCV) to choose the best estimators. PCA extracted ten first principle\ncomponents applied to all supervised algorithms to avoid overfitting and improve training efficiency along with\nthe original features. Experiment 5 performed an unsupervised algorithm with different batch sizes and learning\nrates.\nFinally, the experimental results were compared and evaluated using different measures. Although\naccuracy is the most popular measure for the classification problem, it is not enough to measure the model\nperformance when the data is significantly imbalanced. For example, the models could get high accuracy by\nfocusing on the regular transactions (the majority) and ignoring the fraudulent ones. Therefore, we used two\nwidely applied performance measures for imbalanced data: the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curves\n(AUROC) and average precision as the primary performance measures to compare the model results.\nAUROC indicates the ability to distinguish between classes. In other words, the higher AUROC, the\nbetter model will correctly predict the fraud (positive class) and regular (negative class) transactions. In order to\ncompute AUROC, we first plot the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which is the graph of true\npositive rate (sensitivity) against false positive rate (1 \u2013 specificity). Then, AUROC is closely related to the Gini\ncoefficient and calculated using the trapezoidal rule to estimate the area. It takes values from 0 (inaccurate) to 1\n(perfect accurate), where a value of 0.7 \u2013 0.8, 0.8 \u2013 0.9, more than 0.9 suggest acceptable, excellent, and\noutstanding results, respectively.\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc36 =\n\ud835\udc3a1+1\n(4)\n2\n14Where \ud835\udc3a = 1\u2212 \u2211\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc4b \u2212\ud835\udc4b )(\ud835\udc4c \u2212\ud835\udc4c ) (5)\n1 \ud835\udc58=1 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u22121 \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\u22121\nPrecision is the ratio of accurate predictive positive class (fraud transaction) to all predicted positives\nand estimates the accuracy of the fraud predictions of the model. It ranges from 0 (no precision) to 1 (perfect\nprecision) and is measured as the formula below.\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b = (6)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43\nThe confusion matrix (Table 1) is applied to estimate the effectiveness of a classifier and consists of four\nelements, namely true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN). In our case,\nTP is the number of fraud accurately predicted, while FP is non-fraud transactions miscategorized as fraud.\nSimilarly, TN is the normal transaction accurately predicted, and FN is the fraudulent transaction misrepresented\nas normal.\nPredicted\nPositive Negative\nActual Positive True Positive (TP) False Negative (FN)\nNegative False Positive (FP) True Negative (TN)\nTable 1: Confusion matrix\nIn addition, other measures derived from the confusion matrix such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity\nare also provided. Accuracy is the ratio of accurate fraudulent prediction executed by the algorithm to the total\nobservations to determine its effectiveness in distinguishing the fraud transaction. Sensitivity and specificity\nmeasure the proportion of correctly identified actual fraudulent transactions (positive class) and regular\ntransactions (negative class). Their values range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates the worst result and 1\nindicates the best one.\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66 = (7)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41+\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 = (8)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc66 = (9)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41+\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43\nV. RESULTS\nBefore starting the experiment, t-SNE and PCA for the first two components were used to visualize the\nessence of fraudulent and regular transactions. t-SNE, namely t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, is a\nnonlinear dimensionality reduction technique used for data visualization and mapped to a lower-dimensional\n15space (typically two-dimensional plane) from the multi-dimensional data to identify patterns in the details. This\nalgorithm is widely applied to visualize high-dimensional datasets and is claimed as the best algorithm for 2D\nvisualization in this field. In the t-SNE model, data points are converted based on the joint probabilities, so nearby\npoints are represented by similar samples, while different samples represent distant points. Therefore, it is able to\nexcellently capture the high-dimensional data\u2019s local structure and reveal global data structure, such as clusters\u2019\nexistence.\nAs shown in Figure 7, the data points reflect credit card transactions in a scatter plot, in which regular\nand fraudulent transactions are represented in blues and red, respectively. The two observed clusters identified by\nt-SNE are plotting on the right chart, while those identified by PCA are on the left. As shown in the below figure,\nt-SNE can distinguish between fraudulent and regular transactions, although there are some similar points. In\ncontrast, in the PCA chart, many regular transactions are very similar to fraudulent ones. Therefore, t-SNE, in this\ncase, illustrates better performance in fraud recognition than PCA. Besides, some fraudulent samples are still\nmixed in regular ones in the chart below, which can be considered a trade-off of reducing information from the\ndimensional reduction technique. Consequently, we conducted five experiments to investigate the fraud detection\nability from our proposed models.\n2\ntn\ne\n2\nn o\nn o\np m\nisn o\nC\ne m la\niD p ic\nn\nirP\nDimension 1 Principal Component 1\nFigure 7: t-SNE and PCA visualization\n1. Experiment 1 \u2013 Baseline\nFigure 8 presents the optimal decision tree visualization for fraud detection using the training set. The\ndepth of this tree analysis is 5, with a minimum 6 number of samples required at a leaf node. The node id number\nis also provided to distinguish each node. Besides Gini impurity, the probability that the transactions are\nincorrectly classified according to the subset labels\u2019 distribution is applied to evaluate the quality of splits. Gini\n16value ranges from 0 to 1, where the lower Gini is, the higher chance of the homogeneity of the nodes will be. The\ndecision tree starts from the root node with V14 features not exceeding -3.6 as the splitting rule. Out of 4378\ntraining samples at this node, 314 samples satisfied this rule go to the next decision node 1, while samples that\nfailed this rule go to decision node 14. This node is labeled as fraud with the Gini value of 0.156. Similarly, the\nprocess continues to recur on each subset, in which only unselected attributes from the above nodes are considered.\nThe performance results of four supervised learning algorithms in original features and PCA generated\nby classification reports are shown in Table 2. The precision-recall (PR) curve and ROC curve showing average\nprecision scores and AUROC values of the four algorithms are also illustrated in Figure 9 to compare the\nperformance of the classifiers. Excellent average precision values are observed from the chart as the closer to the\nupper right concern PR curve is, the better its value is. Besides, as shown in Figure 9, the ROC curve above the\ndiagonal line indicates that all algorithms reasonably discriminate to predict fraudulent and normal transactions.\nBesides, the AUROC value is maximized when the ROC reaches the upper left corner, so this experiments\u2019 chart\nreveals a very good model performance. In fact, all AUROC values derived from the chart are greater than 0.9,\ndemonstrating the outstanding test results.\nFor the original features, RF yields the best results in terms of AUROC and average precision with the\nvalue of 0.969 and 0.910, respectively. DT has the worst value of AUROC, while KNN has the worst value of\nprecision. Additionally, PCA has improved the performance of LR and KNN. Consequently, a combination of LR\nand PCA results in the best performance overall, with an AUROC value of 0.971. DT gets the worst AUROC\nresults in both cases; however, DT is usually applied in practice because of its interpretability by visualizing the\noperational flow.\nFor other performance metrics, the four classifiers in experiment 1 all have accuracy values of more than\n0.98 and specificity values of 1, while the sensitivity values range 0.82-0.86. Hence, experiment 1 has indicated\nexcellent results; however, these models are more likely to predict the majority favorably when looking into\nsensitivity and specificity values. The primary purpose is to predict fraud effectively and adapt it for Industry 4.0,\nso action to tackle the above problem is implemented by adjusting the weight of each class, as in experiment 2.\nExperiment 1 Accuracy AUROC Average Sensitivity Specificity\nPrecision\nOriginal LR 0.98 0.950 0.909 0.84 1.00\nfeatures\nKNN 0.99 0.905 0.824 0.85 1.00\nDT 0.98 0.902 0.839 0.82 1.00\nRF 0.98 0.969 0.910 0.83 1.00\nPCA LR 0.99 0.971 0.927 0.84 1.00\nKNN 0.99 0.933 0.865 0.86 1.00\n17DT 0.98 0.900 0.858 0.83 1.00\nRF 0.98 0.960 0.921 0.83 1.00\nTable 2: Experiment 1 Performance Results\nFigure 8: Experiment 1 Decision tree visualization\nA\nB\nFigure 9: Experiment 1 Precision-Recall Curve and ROC Curve.

Experiment 2 \u2013 Adjusted class weights\n18The ratio of regular to fraudulent transactions 10.71 was adjusted to the minority class as class weight.\nAs presented in Table 3, RF has the highest AUROC value of 0.957, while LR has the highest average precision\nvalue of 0.915 for the original features. Features selection models improve the average precision values and\nAUROC values of most algorithms. Overall, RF using PCA shows the best result in experiment 2: the AUROC\nof 0.969 and an average precision score of 0.925. Moreover, it is observed that compared to experiment 1, the\nadjustment of class weight in experiment 2 could improve the performance of supervised algorithms as well as\nenhance the sensitivity of the models, which measures the proportion to detect fraud correctly.

Table 4 highlights that RF applying PCA\nhas the highest AUROC values while LR got the highest precision score in both cases. Among the four models,\nthe performance of RF is the most powerful, while KNN and DT have the lowest results in full features and PCA.\nExcept for the RF model, PCA does not show the performance enhancement in this experiment.

Table 5 indicates that RF algorithm results are\nin the best performance in full features cases and PCA. In addition, AUROC, average precision score, and\n20sensitivity are significantly enhanced when employing PCA with the oversampling method. Overall, RF using\nPCA gives the best outcomes: the AUROC of 0.972 and an average precision score of 0.921, while KNN and DT\nare still the lowest results in experiment 4.

(A) Full features case, (B) PCA case\n5. Experiment 5 - Autoencoder\nAn autoencoder model is designed with two encoder layers with 14 and 7 nodes, respectively. Different\ncombinations of batch sizes and the learning rate are tried to get the optimal result. Table 6 illustrates that the\ndecrease in batch size and increased learning could improve model performance in the AUROC value.\n21Furthermore, it is observed that the regular class\u2019s MSE value ranges from 0.867 \u2013 0.904, while the MSE value\nof fraud is much higher, ranging from 4.976 \u2013 5.010. Therefore, as shown in Figure 13, a flexible threshold of 3\nis chosen to identify the fraud transaction. We also reconstruct errors using MSE for different classes and plot in\nFigure 13. The model detects anomalies as points where the reconstruction error is greater than a threshold of 3\nbecause the normal transactions are likely to have lower error values. Therefore, data points with higher errors\ntend to indicate they are fraud data with higher possibilities, and thus saving more effort in finding fraudulent data.\nFor overall results, experiment 5b indicates the optimal result in both AUROC and average precision score with\nthe value of 0.947 and 0.809, respectively.\nExperiment 5 5.a 5.b 5.c\nBatch sizes 25 16 16\nEpochs 80 80 80\nLearning rate 0.001 0.001 0.100\nFraud class MSE 4.978 4.976 5.010\nNormal class MSE 0.878 0.867 0.904\nAUROC 0.945 0.947 0.948\nAvg precision 0.808 0.809 0.804\nAcuracy 0.96 0.96 0.96\nSensitivity 0.82 0.81 0.81\nSpecificity 0.98 0.98 0.98\nTable 6: Experiment 5 Performance Results\nFigure 13: Reconstruction error of experiment 5b\n6. Findings summary and discussion\nThe performance of the five experiments is summarized as in Figure 14. The models could achieve more\nthan 96% accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 97% specificity. In most cases, the AUROC values of the proposed\nmodel are higher than 0.9. The effects of undersampling and oversample are different for each algorithm.\n22\uf0b7 For LR algorithms, the model with original features and undersampling method (experiment 3) had\nthe highest results of 0.972 for AUROC and 0.928 for average precision. In contrast, the model with\noriginal features and oversampling method had the lowest performance (AUROC: 0.930 and average\nprecision: 0.883). All LR algorithms in the four experiments achieve a high accuracy of more than\n97%.\n\uf0b7 For KNN algorithms, the models with features selection in experiments 1 and 2 (without applying\nany sampling method) have the highest performance values of AUROC and the average precision\nscore of 0.933 and 0.865, respectively.\n\uf0b7 DT model in experiment 2 with original features has the highest AUROC value of 0.952, while the\nmodel applying oversampling method and PCA has the highest average precision value of 0.878\ncompared to DT models in other experiments.\n\uf0b7 RF algorithm has proved to be the best (performing) algorithm for fraud detection with an accuracy\nof 98% and the highest performance results of 0.976 for AUROC and 0.927 for average precision\nfor the model applying undersampling and feature selection.\nOverall, compared to baseline models, the performances of oversampling models are less favorable in\nterms of AUROC value. The integrating undersampling approach achieves better performance when handling\nskewed data than the oversampling and adjusting class weights. Except for the DT undersampling model, feature\nselection using PCA could enhance the AUROC values. RF is the superior performance model across performance\nmetrics, followed by LR. RF with PCA and undersampling achieve the highest AUROC value of 0.976, while LR\nin full features case and undersampling has the highest average precision score value of 0.928.\nFurthermore, autoencoder, unsupervised learning, has consistently achieved good performance with the\naccuracy of 96% through different batch sizes and learning rates. Besides, its results are better than DT and KNN\nin terms of AUROC. Finally, DT has the worst results, particularly when applying oversampling method. However,\nas a trade-off, it has the highest sensitivity, which indicates the ability to detect fraud correctly.\n23Figure 14: (A) AUROC (B) Average Precision by Experiment and model\nVI. CONCLUSION\nDigital payment fraud and fraudulent activities have severe impacts on financial businesses and society,\nparticularly with the popularity of mobile payments, digital wallets, payment cards, and contactless cards in the\nage of Industry 4.0. Significant efforts have been made to tackle such issues. Intelligent approaches such as\nmachine learning algorithms have been successfully utilized and adapted to recognize fraudulent activities\nautomatically for Industry 4.0. This study proposes and evaluates the learning models to detect fraudulent\ntransactions. Therefore, the main contributions are identifying an effective learning model to predict fraud through\na comparative study and assessing the proposed models with real credit card activities data. Our study is essential\nto mitigate the risks of uncertainty and undesirable financial loss suffered by customers and payment providers in\nthe Industry 4.0 era. Secondly, adjustment of hyperparameters automation for supervised learning algorithms is\nemployed to improve fraud classification and reduce times and resources considerably in modeling. There are\nfour supervised learning algorithms applied in the evaluation. In order to estimate the impact of features selection\non classification performance, feature engineering and analysis are conducted. Then, the outcomes have been\ntested with the appraisal of each model addressed. Finally, we also address and propose appropriate solutions for\nthe data skewness matter by considering the effects of oversampling and undersampling techniques. Accuracy is\nnot sensitive to skewed data, so not appropriate as a parameter in this study as it cannot provide a conclusive\ninterpretation. Consequently, we used AUROC and precision as the determining metrics to reach a particular\njudgment. Various methods were brought together to recognize fraudulent activities, and such comparison of these\nfive models (logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest, and autoencoder)is novel and attractive in\nliterature. Results suggested that the integration undersampling method \u2013 NearMiss could improve the models\u2019\nperformance.\n24Acknowledgment\nThis work is partly supported by VC Research (VCR 0000158) for Prof Chang.\nREFERENCES\n[1] B.

The objectives of the study were: to establish the causes of fraud at\nCBA, examine the types of frauds committed and determine the appropriate strategies for\nprevention and control of fraud.\nThe study utilized a descriptive research design using CBA bank as the case. The study was\nconducted during the months of February and March 2014 using all employees of CBA with\nNairobi County. A population of 68 employees representing 33% of the populations were\nincluded in the sample size using a stratified random sampling technique. Data for the study was\ncollected using an online questionnaire for cost and convenience to all the respondents.\nHowever, the questionnaire was pretested for errors and relevance. Data collected was analyzed\nusing SPSS vs. 20 for means, frequency distributions, standard deviations and modes. Analyzed\ndata was presented using figures and tables for ease of interpretation and elaboration.\nThe study found that, fraud in CBA was accorded very high priority. The major causes of fraud\nin the bank were availability of opportunities for fraud, rationalization of fraud acts and pressure\nto commit fraud. Opportunities for fraud were present due to relaxed internal controls and\naccounting systems, inadequate supervision of subordinates, disregard for customer due\ndiligence requirements and poor personnel policies.\nSecondly, this study found that employee fraud was the most common fraud in the bank while\nthird party fraud was second. Management fraud in CBA was very low. Some of the forms of\nfraud identified include: cash theft, use of forged documents, cards fraud, letters of credit fraud\nand impersonation.\nFurther, this study found that there were very effective strategies to prevent and control fraud.\nHowever, the most effective strategies for prevention and control of fraud are: use of ICT tools\nsuch as passwords and firewalls, strengthening of internal controls and systems, encouragement,\ncommunication, rewards and recognition of employees, performance management, improvement\nviiand hiring systems and policies, use of expected and unexpected audits and use of analytical\ntools.\nThe study concluded that the most dominant factor influencing or accelerating fraud in CBA was\nthe availability of opportunities for fraud. Further, the establishment of an ethical culture within\nthe organization structure was critical in fraud management. Secondly, this study concluded that\nemployees are the primary drivers of fraud through forging of documents, opening and\nmanagement of fictitious accounts, claiming unearned benefits and computer frauds. On the\nother hand, management was the least contributors to fraud in the bank. The study further\nconcluded that the most effective strategies for prevention and control of fraud were use of ICT\ntools, use of analytical tools, use of audits, strengthening of internal controls and application of\ncustomer and human resource management systems in the bank.\nThis study recommended that banks should implement systems and structures that reduce the\nopportunities for fraud. In addition to strengthening internal control systems and structures,\nbanks can use ICT tools to reduce opportunities or instill punitive measures for employees\nengaging in fraud and fraud related incidences. Secondly, decentralize the functions of\nemployees and ensure there are adequate authentication and control structures and systems in\nplace to reduce employee fraud. Furthermore, employees should be regularly rotated between\ndepartments. This study recommends that ICT should form the core backbone for the prevention\nand control of fraud. This is because ICT can be used to track, identify and report cases of fraud.\nviiiTABLE OF CONTENTS\nCOPYRIGHT

Sciences\nxivCHAPTER ONE\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 Background of the Problem\nRisk is an inherent part of business life. Dynamic market relations increase the uncertainty of\nthe environment where businesses and public organizations work. Risk management has\nbecome part of the organization activities and its main aim is to help all other management\nactivities reach the organization's aims directly and efficiently. The changes in the\nenvironment require conditions attention for identification and control of risks (Tchankova,\n2002).For a bank; risks are potential events that could influence the achievement of the\norganizations goals. Risk management therefore includes the conceit understanding of the\nevents and how this events poses a threat. Fraud is one major risk that has potential\nsignificant negative impacts on the business. Fraud has an impact on the financial, brand\nimage and reputation of the business (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants,\n2009).\nFraud is an area of convergence for financial firms. Techsavy and young employees are\nleading the proliferation of insider fraud across most businesses in the work. This is opposed\nto insider fraud driven by supervisors, managers and superiors in the business. This has led to\nthe ranking of fraud as one of the top five concerns for both banks and insurers in East Africa\n(PricewaterhouseCoopers [PwC], 2011). Institutional trust plays significant role in fraud\ndetection and prevention. Modern business especially those operating online are using the\nprinciples of institutional trust, to improve and enhance effective governance as a strategy\ntowards reducing fraud. Pan, Seow, Suwardy and Gay (2011) noted that ethics in business is\none strategy that has a direct impact on fraud levels in the business.\nA was survey done by PWC on 33 banks in Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda\nparticipated in the late 2011 and 2010. In this study, the researchers sought to identify the\nrisk identification and risk readiness levels in most local businesses. Over 50% of the\n1respondents to the study indicated that fraud as an area they needed to put more effort in\npreparedness (PwC, 2011). Furthermore, the economic survey of 2010 by PwC found that\nfraud incidents and cases had increased with higher margins in the year 2010 than in any\nother preceding year. Approximately, 90% of the respondents to the study indicated that most\nbusinesses in Kenya had recorded some cases of fraud while banks in the country had lost\nover Ksh 1.7 billion with just three months, August to October, 2010. This growth in the\nbanking fraud was grounded on the rapid growth and expansion in banks which necessitated\nthe implementation of complex multiple technological systems that promoted levels of fraud\n(PwC, 2011). Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal control systems in most banks is\ndwindling in comparison to the boldness and skills of highly networked and sophisticated\nfraudsters (PwC, 2011).\nThere was an upsurge in the prevalence of fraud in a review done in the third quarter on\n2012. Categories of fraud included card frauds, insider, electronic and cheque frauds that\nwere to be given keen focus (Central Bank of Kenya [CBK], 2012). CBK reviewed policy\nimplications based on the trends and gave recommendations to Kenya Bankers Association.\nA total of 36 cases were reported of which 16 cases were successfully investigated and\naccused persons charged in court (Criminal Investigation Department [CID], 2013).\nThe study of fraud encompasses criminology, psychology, accounting, auditing, and\nmanagement. According to Wels (1997), fraud growth and rise can be explained through a\nmodel that consist of three major factors: personal pressure, availability of opportunities and\nrationalization of the act/attitude. The Fraud model has its roots in the research noted by\ncriminologist Donald Cressey. According to Cressey (1973), a sharable financial need is\ncrucial to understanding behavior of one who violates trust to commit fraud. What is deemed\nnon-sharable is in the eyes on the offender (Cressey, 1973).These \u2015non-sharable needs are\ndivided into six basic types: violation of obligations, problems from personal failure,\nbusiness reversals, physical violation, status gaining and employer-employee relationships\n(Cressey, 1973). Duress is caused by employee\u2019s perceived immediate need for assets\n(Cressey, 1973). Pressure causes the fraudster to undertake significant risks to obtain desired\n2resources. Opportunities for fraud occur when an employee acquires trust from an\norganization and abuses it or when the internal control systems in the organizations are very\nweak or absent (Cressey, 1973).\nJustification of the acts of fraud as well as consistency of personal codes of ethics is one\nmajor cause of individual fraud (Hollinger and Clark, 1983). Other factors that lead to the\nincrease and proliferation of fraud include: lack of experience and expertise in fraud\ndetection, IT savvy employees, change resistance by superiors and older generations, lack of\nprofessionalism and competency in recruitment and selection of employees, poor and rigid\njudicial systems and procedures, small fines and court rulings that do not deter fraudsters and\nlack of effective communication and coordination of fraud tracking, detection and prevention\nby banks across the country (PwC, 2011). In addition to financial loss incurred by banks, the\nfinancial cost incurred arising out of court cases should encourage banks that to detect fraud\nin time to save money as well as damage to the banks credibility.\nDuring the time of this research there were 44 banks operating in Kenya under the\nsupervision of the regulatory body-Central Bank of Kenya. They can be categorized into\ngroups based on three key factors namely: the capital base, core capital and branch network\n(PwC, 2009).\nCommercial Bank of Africa (CBA) was the case for this study. Commercial Bank of Africa\nltd was established in the year 1962 in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam. The bank rapidly\nestablished branches in the East African region establishing branches in Mombasa, Nairobi\nand Uganda. Nevertheless, after the Tanzania\u2019s government\u2019s directive to nationalize all\nbanks, CBA was reincorporated in the Kenyan capital in the year 1967 (CBA, 2012).\nAt the initial stages of incorporation and establishment, CBA operated as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Societe Financiere pour les pays D\u2019Outre Mer (SFOM) a Switzerland based\nconglomerate with interests in the Bank sectors such as Bank of America Commerzbank\n(whose interest was later sold to Dresdner Bank), Bank Bruxelles Lambert and Banque\nNational de Paris (CBA, 2012\n3The Bank of America acquired all the shares of SFOM in the year 1980 leading the bank to\nbecome a subsidiary of Bank of America with local investors holding 16% of the shares.\nCommercial Bank of Africa underwent major reorganization and restructuring including the\nadaptation of the global payment systems utilized by the Bank of America to stimulate\ngrowth. However, the Bank of America later sold its stake to local investors though it\nremained as a management consultant for the bank through a management agreement before\nfully disposing its shares to the local investors. Currently, CBA has the accolade of being one\nof the biggest and innovative privately owned bank with branches in Kenya as well as\nTanzania (CBA, 2012).\n1.2 Statement of the Problem\nIn a study by Pan et al., (2012), they concurred with other scholars on fraud that the use of\nthe fraud triangle and other fraud frameworks are crucial in developing a conceptual model\nfor the study and research on fraud. The financial markets have become innovative, creative\nas well as complex which has presented opportunities for fraud. According to Pan et al.,\n(2011), though the fraud triangle provide a framework for understanding fraud, not all types,\ncauses and drivers of fraud are captured in the model. According to Pan et al.,(2011) trends,\npatterns and statistics such as personal characteristics have an impact on the levels of fraud\nthough this is not captured in the model. Essentially, this requires additional investigation of\nthe factors that drive fraud including personal characteristics. Furthermore, Pan\nrecommended in their study that the study of fraud should seek to explore how personal traits\nand characteristics can be used to explain fraud and fraudsters. Furthermore, researchers\nought to develop into a model how individual, firm and industry statistics motivate and drive\nfraud in organizations (Pan et al., 2011).\nWhile the research and recommendations by Pan et al. (2011), were undertaken in the\nEuropean continent, very few studies have focused on fraud management and prevention in\nthe African region and especially the East African region. Existing literature is concentrated\nin the West African region (Abdul and Tinusa 2012; Adenji, 2004; Adewumi, 2011)\n4especially in Nigeria with sparse studies in other regions in Africa. This has created a\nshortage in empirical evidence and studies on the local scene.\nWhile fraud has been identified as a major challenge and issue in the Kenyan banking sector\n(CBK, 2013) very few scholars or studies have sought to establish the causes and strategies\nto combat fraud in the financial sector. This may have had a negative impact on policy\nmaking as policy solutions to fraud were not necessarily informed by empirical evidence.\nNevertheless, the Central Bank of Kenya, the Capital Markets Authority and Kenya Bankers\nAssociation has various researchers who undertake private studies on behalf of the\ninstitutions especially on fraud management. However, these studies are not available to local\ncitizens and researchers as they are institutional properties. This has created a research and\npractice gap in the region. This study sought to fill this gap by investigating the factors that\ncontribute to fraud in the banking industry.\n1.3 General Objectives\nThe general objective of this study was to assess fraud in the banking industry.\n1.4 Specific Objectives\n1.4.1 To establish factors contributing to fraud in the banking industry\n1.4.2 To examine the types of frauds committed against banks\n1.4.3 To determine appropriate strategies of preventing and controlling fraud\n1.4 Importance of the Study\nThe research is of use to decision makers in the banking industry, policy makers, scholars\nand the researchers.\n51.5.1 Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd\nAuditor\u2019s security teams, hiring managers and operations managers can have a better\nunderstanding of the factors that contribute to fraud. CBA can draw from the findings of this\nstudy on the different ways of mitigating fraud.\n1.5.2 Banking Industry\nBanks are able to gain a deeper understanding of fraud and adopt appropriate strategies to\nmitigate loss resulting from fraudulent activities. This is due to new knowledge and\ninformation available as a result of the study.\n1.5.3 Policy Makers\nThis may include Kenya Bankers Association, Central Bank of Kenya and Banking Fraud\nUnit. The Policy makers can develop appropriate policies and alternative actions based on\nempirical evidence and data.\n1.5.4 Researchers and Scholars\nThe researcher gained experience in research and will use the results to detect, recommend\nand review existing policies revolving on operations in departments that are prone to fraud.\nScholars will find the study useful as a source of knowledge and insight while others may use\nit for future research on the banking industry and the factors that motivate fraud in the\nbanking industry.\n1.5 Scope of the Study\nThis study was conducted using a sampling frame of all employees in the 17 branches within\nNairobi County. The total population of the study was 650. In total there were 204 employees\nwho formed the sampling frame. The data was collected during the months of January and\n6March 2014 using Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) as the case study. This was done using\na questionnaire between the 20th of February and 10th of March 2014.\nThe researcher encountered the following limitations in the course of the research: Data\naccess limitations: information held by auditors about fraud was sensitive to the bank and\nwas not easily available. This was countered by assuring the information providers of\nanonymity and confidentiality. Furthermore, confidentiality agreements with the respondents\nwere arrived at during data collection.\n1.6 Definition of Terms\n1.7.1 Fraud\nFraud is a deliberate deception to obtain illicit material gain, and includes embezzlement and\nasset misappropriation (Pan et al., 2011).\n1.7.2. Control Systems\nA control system consists of subsystems and processes put together for the purpose of\ncontrolling the outputs of the process (Ganesh A. and Raghurama, A., 2008).\n1.7 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter has presented the background of the study including the fraud risks and\nchallenges identified by PwC and CBK. This background informs the problem of the\nstatement, research questions, and scope of the study and the importance of the study.\nChapter two reviews the existing literature on banking fraud drawn from books, journals and\ndissertations. Chapter three presents the research methodology and design to be used in the\nresearch. Chapter four of the study presents the findings and interpretations from data\ncollected and analyzed. Chapter five presents the discussion of findings, conclusions and\nrecommendations of the study.\n7CHAPTER TWO\n2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW\n2.1 Introduction\nAs business becomes more complex and management strategists fret over slashing costs and\nboosting profits, employees are gaining additional opportunities to commit fraud. Recent\ntrends towards downsizing, reengineering and corporate layoffs, and organizations have a\nvery volatile workforce, often without much company loyalty. This environment is ripe for\ncomputer and employee fraud (Haugen, 1999). Banking fraud hurts both banks and their\ncustomers.\nThis chapter reviewed literature on the factors that cause fraud specifically in the banking\nindustry. This was covered in three sections namely: the factors that cause fraud in the\nbanking industry, the types of fraud and also preventive and control measures.\n2.2 Factors that Contribute to Fraud in the Banking Industry\nFraud cannot be studied, examined or attributed to one factor only. On the contrary, a\nmultifaceted and multifactor approach to the study of fraud must be undertaken. Looking at a\nfraudsters perspectives, it is necessary to take account of motivation of potential offenders,\ncondition under which people can rationalize their prospective crimes away, opportunities to\ncommit crimes, perceived suitability of targets for fraud , technical ability of the fraudster,\nthe possibility and likelihood of fraud discovery and carrying out, expectations and\nconsequences ( job loss, family stigma and proceeds of crime confiscation and actual\nconsequences of discovery (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants [CIMA] , 2009).\nA research conducted by Kingsley (2012) in Nigeria revealed that institutional factors that\nlead to fraud may include but are not limited to weak accounting system control systems,\ninadequate supervision of subordinates, disregard of Know Your Customer rule, poor\ninformation technology and data base management, hapless personnel policies, poor salaries,\n8general frustration occasioned by management unfulfilled promises, failure to engage in\nregular call over, employees refusal to abide with laid down procedures without any penalty,\nbanks reluctant to report fraud due to the perceived negative publicity, banking experience\nof staff and inadequate infrastructure that may include poor communication systems result to\na buildup of unbalanced posting, inadequate training, poor book keeping and genetic traits\nlike kleptomaniac who pathologically steals for fund (Kingsley, 2012) .\nSocial factors are those that can be traced to the immediate and remote environment which\nmay include penchant to get rich quick, slow legal process, poverty widening gap, job\ninsecurity, peer group pressure, societal expectations, financial burden on individuals, stiff\ncompetition in the banking industry may see banks engaging in fraud to meter up in terms of\nliquidity and profitability (Kingsley, 2012).\nAccording to a survey done in 2009 by fraud examiners, the current increase in fraud cases\nstems from the intense pressure faced by individuals. According to the study, fraud grows\nand thrives under three major factors: pressure on employees to commit, availability of\nopportunities for fraud and the ability of the employee to rationalize the act of fraud (Pan et\nal, 2011). However, this factors may drive fraud under differing conditions and\nenvironments. The factors may lead to proliferation of fraud during economic hardships\nespecially when the organization and or the employees are undergoing times of economic\nand financial strain. Similarly, as companies seek to reduce their level of employees or\nreduce their expenditure especially on employee allowances and remuneration, the\nopportunities for fraud may increase due to a reduction in the effectiveness of internal\ncontrols. This is infract grounded in the findings of the study of the Association of Certified\nFraud Examiners (ACFE) (2009) in which over 80% of the respondents indicated that\neconomic hardships was a reason for the growth of growth in fraud. Employee layoff has the\neffect of establishing gaps in the internal control systems which promote fraud. In effect the\nACFE (2009) concluded that there exists an inverse relationship between fraud in the\norganization and its economic strength.\n9Trust in employees is also a driver of fraud in organizations. According to Cressey (1973)\ntrusted employees can lead to increases in fraud especially where the guilty employees\nperceives to have a dilemma or financial problem which he/she deems not shareable with the\nmanagement or fellow employees. If the employee genuinely believes that the violation of\nthe trust may lead to the solution of the problem, the employee will most likely violate this\ntrust and secretly resolve the problem (Cressey, 1973).\nInsider theft has a significant negative impact on the profitability of the business. Existing\nstatistics show that over 33% of all bankruptcies in businesses is primarily driven by\nemployee theft. (Wang and Kleiner, 2005). However, this may not come as a surprise to the\nmanagement which will have identified this through indicators such as rumors, inventory\nshortages, reduced earnings etc. Rationalization of the fraud act, poor internal controls, lack\nof implementation of laws and policies and managements indifference to the acts of fraud are\nmajor drivers of employee theft (Wang and Kleiner, 2005). In addition, employees argue that\nthe management creates opportunities for fraud which is their primary motivator of fraud\nrather than their financial need. Furthermore, most employees believe that management\ninaction against fraud is a major driver of fraud in the organization (Wang and Kleiner,\n2005). This means that if an organization/management expects a fraud free environment it\nmust set examples through honesty, action and adherence to policies (Wang and Kleiner,\n2005).\nA red flag is a set of circumstances that is unusual in nature or vary from normal activity. It is\na signal that something is out of the ordinary and may need to be investigated. Employee red\nflags include lifestyle changes (expensive cars, jewelry, homes clothes, and significant\npersonal debt and credit problems) behavioral changes, high turnover especially in areas\nvulnerable to fraud, refusal to take vacations or sick leave and lack of segregation of duties in\nthe vulnerable areas. A fraud model brings together all these aspects of fraud. According to\nACFE (2009) his factors are embedded in a model grounded on three factors promoting\nfraud: motivation to fraud, availability of opportunities and rationalization of the act of fraud\n(ACFE, 2009).\n102.2.1 Pressure to Commit Fraud\nThe pressure to commit fraud may emanate from different sources. Nonetheless, Wilson\n(2004) noted that greed in employees is the major sources of pressure. This relates to duress\nthat is caused by an employee immediate need for assets (Cressey, 1973). Hillison et al.\n(1999) state that 95% of all fraud cases involve needs caused by financial difficulties or vice\nrelated activities. Pressure pushes the fraudster to take risks in order to obtain what they\nwant. Notably, an emergency of finance is only seen from the view of the fraudster to the\nlead to act of fraud. The pressure may actually now even be seen by a third party observer. It\nis the combination of emergency and need that is common to the concept of pressure to\ncommit fraud. Pressures are often not readily apparent from day to day activities, then fraud\ninvestigators need to gain knowledge and understanding of the employees and to consider\ntypes of pressures that prevail.\nHillison et al. (1999) found that numerous employee situations are consistent with actual or\nperceived pressure. For example: Greed or preoccupation with successful, living beyond\none\u2019s means, high personal debts, high medical bills, poor credit or inability to obtain credit,\nunexpected financial needs, personal financial losses, expensive habits such as the use of\ndrugs, alcohol or gambling, illicit sexual relationships, work related pressure such as low\npay, failure to receive a promotion unfair treatment, lack of respect or dissatisfaction with\none\u2019s job, boredom, challenge to see if you can beat the system without getting caught and\nspouse or family related imposed pressures (Hillson et al., 1999).\nEvery fraudster faces some kind of perceived pressure most of which involve a financial\nneed. There exists various non-financial pressures that can lead to fraud. Albrecht (2008)\nnoted that when an employee is under pressure to perform, wants to display better than actual\nperformance, is experiencing frustration at the work place or even has set challenges to beat\nthe system, this are adequate motivators of fraud. Pressures perceived by one individual, such\nas a gambling addiction, may not be pressure to another individual. Some of the financial\npressures that enhance and enable the proliferation of fraud are financial losses, falling sales,\n11failure to meet earnings expectation or inability to compete with other companies (Albrecht,\n2008).\n2.2.2 Opportunity to Commit Fraud\nOpportunity is the first important factor motivating fraud. . Opportunities to commit fraud\nrepresent gaps, deficiencies, weaknesses and loopholes in the internal control systems of a\nbusiness that an employee can utilize to commit fraud (Wilson, 2004). Hillison et al. (1999)\nfound that opportunities to commit fraud can arise when an employee acquires absolute trust\nin an organization where the internal controls are weak or nonexistent. The employee will\nthen perceive that an opportunity exists to commit fraud, conceal it and avoid detection.\nCompanies with weak internal controls are at higher risks of recording fraud cases and\nopportunities for fraud. According to CIMA (2009) where a business does not have adequate\nsecurity over its assets and property and exposes the assets the likelihood of fraud is higher\nthan otherwise. On the other hand despite the levels of honesty in employees (i.e. from total\nhonesty to total dishonesty) the availability of opportunities may sway the employee into\ncommitting fraud.\nHillison et al. (1999) noted that strong internal control systems are an important means of\nlimiting the opportunity for fraud but when controls exists, a person with unlimited access\nand overriding authority gained through trust may be able to override the controls to commit\nfraud. While auditors cannot readily regulate the pressure attribute, they can help mitigate\nopportunity to commit fraud. Typical failures in control related issues that increase\nopportunity for fraud include: lack of segregation of duties, failure to inform staff about\ncompany rules and the consequences of violating them, rapid turnover of employees,\nconstantly operating under crisis conditions, lack of an audit trail, ineffective supervision,\nlack of transaction authorizations, poor accounting records, lack of physical controls, lack of\naccess to information, breakdown of procedures. Employees attempting to commit fraud are\nlikely to work unusual hours and do not take days off (Hillson et al., 1999).\n122.2.3 Rationalization of the Act of Fraud\nRationalization of the act of fraud also known as the moral justification through which\nemployees create an attitude or thought that committing fraud is proper and right. It is\ncreated when an employee justifies his actions or crime through statements such as: it will be\nimpossible for the company to find, the company can do without it, I am stealing, the\ncompany does not recognize my efforts and therefore it\u2019s my reward for hard work (Clark\nand Hollinger, 1983). This justification for the act of fraud often lead to fraud in the business.\nJustification of the acts of fraud can also emanate from the actions of superiors who engage\nin fraud. Junior employees will therefore engage with the rationalization that others are doing\nit, the earnings of the business are adequate to cover the losses or I am angry at the company\n(Clark and Hollinger, 1983). In summary Clark and Hollinger (1983) argued that most\nindividuals commit fraud due to the consistency in the justification and the personal code of\nethics.\nHillison et al. (1999) stated that for most, personal integrity may be the key limiting factor in\nkeeping a person from misusing assets. That is, many employees would not commit fraud\neven if a need or opportunity arose. Many individuals observe the rules and regulation\nbecause they have faith in it and or are terrified of being humiliated or rejected by people\nthey care about if they are caught. CIMA (2009) further notes that individuals may\nrationalize the act of fraud since they have they believe and perception that the victim is well\ncushioned or protected from the impact arising from the fraud or because the victim deserves\nit. Rationalization is personal to the person and more difficult to combat (CIMA, 2009).\nIn summary it is evident that employees attitude are modelled towards committing fraud due\nto perceptions of low remuneration, too much work and too little compensation, being at par\nwith others who are committing fraud, perceptions that there is prestige and privilege in\nfraud, low self-esteem and respect, as an act of revenge, intuitions that it\u2019s only a loan and\nwill be repaid and other justifications such as it will be paid, no one is getting hurt, it\u2019s for a\ngood case or it\u2019s only a temporary alternative.\n132.3 Types of Fraud\nFraud has been classified in various ways using various parameters: Management fraud,\nInsiders who are purely employees of the banks, outsiders who are customers or non-\ncustomers of the banks and insiders /outsiders, which is a partnership of the employees\n(insiders) and outsiders.\n2.3.1 Management Fraud\nThis is frequently committed by management staff e.g. general managers, managing\ndirectors. The victims of this kind of fraud are investors and creditors and this is done via\nfinancial statements. Management fraud is driven by the need to acquire more resources from\nnew and existing share capital holders or suppliers. Management fraud may also be driven by\nthe need to create a good corporate image/standing of the business in the eyes of the regulator\nor supervisor e.g. Central Bank and Kenya Bankers Association.\nManagement in most organizations is perpetrated through two major avenues: deception and\ndeprivation. Management can overstate its assets or and revenues or understate liabilities and\nor expenses. ACFE (2011) believes that it is carried out through fictitious revenues, timing\ndifference, improper asset valuation concealed liabilities and expenses and improper or\ninadequate discourse (Kingsley, 2012).\n2.3.2 Employee Fraud\nEmployee fraud often referred to as non-management fraud is primarily committed by the\nemployees of the banks (Kingsley, 2012; Tchankova, 2002). Employee fraud is mainly\ncharacterized by cash theft from bank tills, forgeries of customers signatures with the\nintention of withdrawing monies from the customer account, opening and operating fictitious\naccounts and illegal transfer of funds to other accounts (Tchankova, 2002: Akinyomi, 2012:\nKingsely, 2012).\n14Employee fraud can also be driven through illegal transfer of funds and assets, false balance\ncrediting, opening, use and management of fictional accounts, claiming of overtime for hours\nnot worked, fund diversion ( tapping funds from interest into a suspense account) computer\nfraud via compromising log in credentials of an e-banking user (Akinyomi, 2012: Kingsely,\n2012).\nACFE (2009), Kingsely (2012) and Akinyomi (2012) in their respective studies on fraud in\nthe financial and banking sector noted that staff can also collude to misappropriate\norganizations assets e.g. cash, inventory customer information. Therefore banks must take\ninto consideration the location, place and security of assets and the responsible employees for\nthe assets. Common employee fraud schemes include employees creating and paying for\nnon-existent goods and services, payment of invoices that are inflated or made up,\npresentation of inflated and fake credit notes, customer list theft and unlawful acquisition of\nproprietary information (Kingsley, 2012).\nBank staff that have access to tangible assets and the accounting systems that record and\ntrack the activities of an employee. However, technologically savvy employees can use the\nsame systems to conceal their identities and theft. This is especially so when the staff\nestablish fake vendor accounts and embed them in the master file to enhance payment\nprocessing. Furthermore employees can steal products or assets of the company and charge\nthe same to the cost of sales which reduces the profitability of the company while asset sales\nand removal for asset list will reduce the asset of the company (AFCE, 2009). Given the\ntransition to a service based, knowledge economy and more valuable assets of a bank are\nintangible e.g. customer lists and copy righted material. Intangible assets theft may include\nthe unauthorized copying and use of software\u2019s and other intellectual property (AFCE, 2009).\n2.3.3 Third Party Fraud\nFrauds perpetrated by customers and non-customers of banks are outsider fraud. These may\ninclude the following:\n152.3.3.1 Cheque Fraud\nThis is the oldest financial crime. It is the commonest method by which customers and the\nbank are defrauded. Counterfeit cheques not written or authorized by legitimate account\nholder, forged cheques where a stolen cheque not signed by account holder, or altered cheque\nwhere an item that has been properly issued by the account holder but has been intercepted\nand the payee and/or the amount of the item have been altered (Onkagba,1993).\nForgeries is one entrenched mode of fraud where employees forge and copy a customer\u2019s\nsignature with the aim of withdrawing funds from the customer\u2019s account. The major target\naccounts for forgeries are targeted savings account, deposit accounts, current accounts or\ntransfer instruments. Experience has shown that most of such forgeries are perpetrated by\ninternal staff in partnership with outsiders with the employees providing sample signatures of\nthe customers (Akinyomi, 2012).\n2.3.3.2 Kitting\nKitting involves the use of the time that normally lapses between depositing and clearing a\ncheque to acquire authorized loans without any interest. The primary objective of kitting is to\nutilize funds and interest fees to conceal short term cash deficiencies and shortages or to\nacquire funds for personal use. Competition among banks encourages bank to make funds\navailable before time in order to attract special business accounts (Onkagba, 1993).\n2.3.3.3 Misrepresentations and Impersonation\nFraudsters make false statements and or submit falsified documents including rent rolls, lien\nwaivers and financial statements to boost loan applications. They may also make fraudulent\ndisbursement requests to receive loan proceeds. This fraud activity may occur across simple\nbanks using multiple accounts by opening an account with false identification (Onkagba,\n1993).\n16In impersonation and misrepresentation, the fraudster always assumes the identity of another\nindividual with the goal of committing a fraud or dishonest activity. Impersonation may be\ndone to acquire cheque books to commit fraud or acquisition of cheque leafs for fraud\npurposes. According to Akinyomi (2012) impersonation is particularly very successful where\nthe outsider works in collaboration with an insider.\n2.3.3.4 Counterfeit Securities\nThis occurs when a good quality instrument is forged and used as an alternative to the stocks\nor assets as security for a loan. The fraudster gets the funds and disappears before the bank\nnotes the documents are counterfeit. Counterfeits are one of the oldest forms of crime which\nhas proliferated due to the advancement of photographic equipment and tools which has\nhelped criminals to produce counterfeit documents that are of high quality and resemble\noriginal documents. According to Onkagba (1993) counterfeit documents may be copied,\nforged or simply changed in its details e.g. dates, terms of payment or holder.\n2.3.3.5 Money Transfer Fraud\nMoney transfer services refers to the movement of financial assets and resources from one\naccount to another mostly the beneficiary account. Money transfer can occur through mail,\ntelephone or at the counter, mobile phones or through other electronic systems. Money\ntransfer fraud occurs when the beneficiaries detailed are changed or altered to reflect those of\na different individual or beneficiary (Onkagba, 1993).\n2.3.3.6 Clearing Fraud\nClearing fraud can be committed by substituting cheques to enable a fraudster divert funds to\na wrong beneficiary. There is also suppression of cheques such that at the end of the time\nrequired to clear a cheque the bank gives value as like authorizing bank had accepted\npayment of the value of the instrument (Onkagba, 1993).\n172.3.3.7 Letter of Credit Fraud\nLetter of credit (also documentary credit) is a well-known payment method in international\ntrade. This instrument has two fundamental principles: the autonomy or independent\nprinciple and the doctrine of strict compliance. Such principles intending to facilitate\ninternational transactions make letter of credit easy to be abused by fraudsters. Traders from\ndeveloping countries who lack sufficient experience and knowledge of letters of credit are\noften the targets from an economic point of view; it is true that checking credibility involved\ninformation costs. It is better to incur the cost that the potential cost that would be involved if\nfraud were to occur. Apart from carefully checking the credibility of the seller beforehand,\nthe buyer must cautiously choose suitable trade terms which allocate the risk of goods, cost,\nliability between buyer and seller (Zhang, 2013).\nThe Letter of Credit fraud occurs mostly in international trade where a supplier receives a\nspurious letter of credit, which is usually accompanied by bank drafts with fake\nendorsements which guarantees payments (Onkagba, 1993).\n2.3.3.8 Card Fraud\nThis is committed at ATMS and posterminals. Fraudsters create a replica of a legitimate card\nor copying data contained in the cards magnetic stripe. Using this information, the criminals\nthen use the cards (Onkagba, 1993). A fraudster can also use a giraffe method to monitor the\ninformation the customer keys into the ATM machine unknown to customers. A jammed\nATM card can cause a customer to lose money. A fraudster pretending to be a genuine\nsympathizer will suggest that a victim reenter his or her security code. When the card holder\nleaves, the fraudster retrieves the card and reenters the code that he has doctored\nclandestinely. Fraudsters can also use data collected from tiny cameras and devices called\nskimmers that capture card information (Adeoti, 2011).\n182.4 Prevention and Control of Fraud\nFraud risk is a contributor to the operational risks of a business. Operational risks refers to\nthe errors and events in a transaction or process that put the assets of the business at risk.\nSome of the risks considered as operational risks include: incorrect and intentional false\naccounting, theft of assets or misappropriation of assets. Most banks focus on a limited\nnumber of risks mostly commonly of third party thefts but it\u2019s important to classify risks to\npossible type of offence and the potential perpetrators (Gates & Jacob, 2009).\nIt is important to assets fraud risk in each and every area of the business. However, special\nattention must be granted to high risk areas and departments such as cash and cash\nmanagement, payments, sales and fixed assets. Management and acquisition of loans is also a\nkey area of fraud risk management. As most researchers have found, fraud has a significant\nnegative impact on the sustainability and profitability of a business. Businesses must\ntherefore invest time and resources to the identification, management and control of fraud\n(CIMA, 2009). Further, existing studies have shown that the most effective methods of\ncombating fraud include: reducing the motive of employees, enhancing internal controls thus\nreducing opportunities and ensuring that there is no justification of acts of fraud through\nproper supervision and implementation of rules and regulation plus punitive action against\nfraud (CIMA, 2009).\nKingsley (2012) noted that to reduce cases of fraud while enhancing the fraud detection and\nprevention strategies, businesses must have internal control systems embedded in the\noperational framework. Fraud in the banking sector and in deed in all businesses can be\nreduced if all control devices built into the system are implemented, enhanced and respected.\nBanks incur substantial operating costs by refunding customers\u2019 monetary losses (Gates &\nJacob, 2009), while bank customers experience considerable time and emotional losses. They\nhave to detect the fraudulent transactions, communicate them to their bank, initiate the\nblocking and re-issuance or re-opening of a card or account, and dispute the reimbursement\n19of their monetary losses (Douglass & Malthus, 2009). It is therefore in a bank\u2019s self-interest\nto put measures to prevent fraud or detect it as soon as it happens\nAn anti-fraud strategy includes elements of prevention, detection, deterrence and response.\nBusiness must develop concise and clear strategic responses towards fraud. This will include\neffective communication on the seriousness of fraud and the probable punitive measures\ntaken due to fraud in the business. Identified cases must form case studies and examples of\nthe stern action taken by the business against fraud. This is one of the most effective ways to\ncombat fraud in the organization (CIMA, 2009).\n2.4.1 Creating an Encouraging Work Atmosphere\nPositive and good working environments enhances the compliance of employees to\nestablished rules, policies and procedures which are set for the success and sustainability of\nthe business. A good working environment enhances communication between employees and\nmanagement and guarantees positive employee recognition and great reward system. This\nkind of working atmosphere reduces the levels of internal fraud in the organization\n(Kingsley, 2012). A workforce culture includes having adequate and sufficient policies,\nrules, regulations, procedures, protocols and practices human resource management of\nemployees (recruitment, selection, orientation, development, remuneration, career\nadvancement, motivation, training and termination) to deter fraudulent and corrupt behaviors\ninclude practices that deal swiftly with incidents and protect whistle blowers (ACFE, 2009).\n2.4.2 Ethical Culture\nAn ethical culture includes defining principles and values have indicators of high levels of\nethics in the organization as well as zero tolerance to corruption and fraud. It also enhances\nethical climate and mental notes in the employees not to engage in fraud and corrupt\nactivities. Ethical culture should be incorporated via ethical leadership through rewards and\nacknowledgement as a model of appropriate conducts in the face factors and behaviors that\nwould promote or motivate employees to engage in fraud (ACFE, 2009).\n20Attitudes within an organization often lay the foundation for a low or high risk fraud\nenvironment. In a high risk environment, petty issuers, expense fraud and other minor forms\nof fraud are overlooked or dealt with leniently. In low risk fraud environment, the business\ntakes serious action on minor or major acts of fraud. In some cases, there may even be risk of\ntotal collapse of the organization either through a one act of fraud or very many small acts of\nfraud. Organizations have come to realize that high ethical standards bring long term benefits\nas customers and the community realizes that they are dealing with trustworthy\norganizations. They have also realized that improper, adverse actions, fraud and corruption\noften cause serious negative impacts to the people and organizations concerned when\nexposed (CIMA, 2009).\n2.4.3 Types of Employees\nCost of hiring dishonest employees cannot be calculated: A dishonest employee will\ndestabilize any effort to build a positive work atmosphere and constantly strive to defeat any\ninternal measures. Companies should ensure they conduct a background check that covers\ncriminal history, education, previous employment, civil history for possible lawsuits before\nemploying anyone. The need to hire honest staff cannot be overemphasized (Kingsley\n2012).\nFraud and business risk in any organization is inherent in the hired employees especially in\nsenior positions where trust and authority are critical. Therefore it is crucial to conduct due\ndiligence on employees and know them in order to authenticate their competence and\ncredentials. Furthermore, this is important in knowing the integrity of the employee and how\nthis will influence his actions in the organization. Employee due diligence can be undertaken\nthrough confirmation of education qualification, work experience and history and follow up\nwith the references provide. In addition, due diligence may be crucial in acquiring\nundisclosed information by the employee especially one that may have an impact on the\nintegrity of the employee (ACFE, 2009).\n21In undertaking employee due diligence, the business must take into consideration the\napplicable rules and regulations. This is because the rules and regulations will guide the\nconduct and acquisition of the information. Nevertheless, the business can acquire\nbackground information of the employee through authorized criminal record survey. Other\nstrategies to acquire information about an employee include acquiring legal counsel on how\nto conduct and acquire employee information. Due diligence should also be undertaken on\nbank customers, suppliers and partners to identify any information with an impact on the\nfinancial health, ownership, reputation and integrity which may possess an unacceptable\nlevels of risk (ACFE, 2009).\nBierstaker, Brody and Pacini (2006) found that it is important to note that an employee with\nfraud schemes may move from one organization to another. When employee records are not\nchecked, dishonest people may be hired. An organization should not rely on telephone\nnumbers listed on the resume for prior employers as they may be false. A company should\ntry obtain employer telephone numbers independently. Organizations should also conduct a\nsecond reference check six months after an employee starts work. This is because for a\ndishonest employee, may have not been filed at the time of the initial search. This may be\ndiscovered by a second check.\n2.4.4 Perform Expected and Unexpected Audit\nUnannounced financial audits and fraud assessments should be done regularly. This can help\nunearth any vulnerability and appraise the effectiveness to the existing controls (Kingsley,\n2012).Hillison et al. (1999) found that surprise fraud audits have potential to act as a\ndeterrent to employee fraud. A surprise audit gives perpetrators less time to alter, destroy or\nhide records and other evidence. Some firms may be reluctant to use surprise, preemptive\nfraud audits because of a perception of adverse employee reactions. Honest employees\nshould be made to understand the importance of fighting fraud. It may be important for\nmanagement to periodically communicate to employees the importance of audits and also to\n22solicit staff input on how to conduct surprise audits. This may help in reducing suspicion and\nfacilitate co-operation.\n2.4.5 Enforce Internal Controls\nThis is designed to promote operational efficiency, provide dependable financial statistics,\nprotect the assets and records and encourage adherence to prescribed policies. A sound\ninternal control system have features that promote efficiency and effective tracking of\ntransactions and ensuring that all activities are properly authorized, recorded, and reconciled\n(Kingsley, 2012).\nAn internal control system should have all principles and procedures that support the\norganizations effective and effective operation. They deal with things like approval and\nauthorization procedures, restrictions and control over transactions, reconciliation of\nactivities and accounts and provision of security to assets. The number of internal controls\nthat an organization can have depends on nature and size. Internal controls minimize fraud.\nExamples of such controls may include requirement of multiple signatures for high value\ntransactions, restriction belongings that can be brought into an office and conducting random\nsearches.\nAs part of the risk management framework, the organization must review the internal\ncontrols and ensure that any weaknesses in the internal controls are addressed. Furthermore,\nthe organization has the responsibility of ensuring that internal controls are assessed and\nupdated to meet global trends and best practices constantly. This will reflect good practice.\nFinally, these internal controls should be entrenched within the organization culture and\noperations (CIMA, 2009).\n2.4.6 Compensation Programs\nIt is a human trait to want recognition and reward for positive performance and success.\nContinuous and rigorous assessment of employees performance, coupled with constant,\n23timely and effective communication to the employee on the performance assessment has a\nhuge bearing on the reduction of fraud. As part of the employee assessment process the\norganization must recognize and if possible reward any accomplishments of the employees,\nespecially those whose performance require so. Furthermore, employees must feel that the\nreward is of value to them. Failure to do so will lead to guilt feelings, low motivation and\ndemoralization of employees which might create rationalizations for acts of fraud.\nMarket research and surveys must also be done by the organization to identify whether the\nremuneration and compensation of employees is adequate, motivating and in line with\nindustry trends. The findings of the survey will also be instrumental in striking a balance\nbetween the use of fixed and variable compensation. It is good to note that if compensation is\nbased on compensation for short term performance, managers maybe motivated to cut\ncorners or fabricate financial results to achieve those bonuses (ACFE, 2009).\n2.4.7 Establish a Fraud Policy\nEvery bank should have an approach to deal with fraud. The approach should be clearly\nstated in the fraud policy. This is established to facilitate the implementation and\nactualization of internal controls which will aid in detection and prevention of fraud against\ncompanies. The must be applicable to any wrongdoing, or suspected misdeed, involving all\nstakeholders in the business (ACFE, 2009).\nA fraud policy should have a scope, what actions constitute a fraud, the unit responsible for\ninvestigations, confidentiality clauses, and an authorization for investigating suspected fraud,\nreporting procedures, and termination procedures. A bank fraud policy should be separate\nand distinct from a corporate code of conduct or ethics policy. It should be clearly\ncommunicated to all employees through new orientation of new hires, annual training\nseminars and annual performance evaluations. It is important to have a written\nacknowledgement by each employee that the policy has been read and understood as required\nas stated by (Hillison, Pacini and Sinason, 1999).\n242.4.8 Establishing a Telephone Hot Line\nCIMA (2009) notes that a dedicated and confidential 24/7 hotline to report fraud is one of the\nmost effective strategies to combat fraud. The hotline must be strictly confidential and will\ngreatly aid the company\u2019s efforts to detect fraud. Indeed, studies have shown that most losses\nin an organization are caused by the ignorance of small signs and lack of fraud detection\nstrategies. In addition to installation of a telephone hotline, every member of the organization\nmust be aware that it is his/her responsibility to report any kind of fraud or irregularity in the\nbusiness. Therefore, the hotline must have inbuilt facilities that ensure that the identity of the\nreporter is not revealed whether by choice or default (CIMA, 2009).\nAnonymous tips received through hotlines are an effective strategy and channel to detecting\nfraud. The hotline should be utilized to create awareness, ensure ease in use and prompt\nactions on reports on the hotline. Education of employees on the use of the hotline is also\nimportant since they are the source of information.\nTo enhance the efficiency of the hotline it must be manned by a qualified and experienced\nemployee who has multilingual abilities and is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nOnce a fraud has been reported via the hotline, it would be important to let the whistle blower\nknow that timely action will be taken. It would be important to analyze collected data against\nthe industry norm. Hotlines may be supported in-house or provided by a third party (ACFE,\n2009).\nBierstaker et al. (2006) found that some companies offer third party hotline service where a\nbank can subscribe. The annual subscription rate may be quite modest. The results of all calls\nare provided to the client within two or three days. A hotline may not be an effective\ndetection tool but it enhances deterrence. Potential perpetrators will likely have second\nthoughts when considering the risks of being caught.\n252.4.9 Enforce Mandatory Vacations\nA mandatory vacation policy is used to insure banks. The policy requires that all officers take\ntwo consecutive weeks of vacation per year. It is important that vacations include an\nemployee\u2019s high risk tasks. Job rotation programs should also be designed so that employee\nhas little or no access to the documents, journals, data files, programs and other items that he\nhas worked with on previous job. Mandatory vacations and job rotations plans deter fraud as\nwell as allow existing frauds scheme to surface (Hillison et al, 1999).\n2.4.10 Protect Information Systems\nA fraud using or against an information system may be through entering false or fraudulent\ndata into an information system or alteration of computer programs or code. One can\nprogram the computer to round off shillings and cent amounts down and accumulate\nfractions of cents in an account to which the fraudster has access. One can also steal data\nfrom an information system e.g. bank customer lists, merger plans etc. Computer fraud has\nincreased because of the growth of internet which has increased the dial \u2013in ports to\ncomputer networks. Although passwords are the oldest line of computer defense, they still\nconstitute the most effective and efficient method of controlling access. Proper password use\nis necessary if control is to be maintained (Bierstake et al., 2006).\nEmployees in the bank should always ensure they change the default assigned passwords\nsuch as their last names to a more secure one. Employees should also be prohibited from\nsharing passwords with other users. Password security requires that they can be changed\nperiodically (Bierstake et al., 2006).\nAn organization operating system should keep track of unsuccessful attempts to gain access\nand limit attempts before the user is automatically signed off according to Hillison et al.\n(1999).Technology has advanced to create new forms of passwords protection using\nbiological features of the user such as voice prints, finger prints, retina patterns and digital\nsignatures (Bierstake et al., 2006).\n262.4.11 Increase the Use of Analytical View\nBierstake et al. (2006) found that increase the use of analytical view can assist to prevent and\ndetect fraud. Fraud can affect financial statement trends and rations. Accounts may therefore\nbe manipulated to conceal a fraud. It may be important for an investigator to analyze several\nyears of financial statement data to obtain a clear picture of the financial impact of the crime\nif any. Fraud analysts should check for erratic patterns in account balances. If present it\nmeans there is a fraudulent activity.\n2.5 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter has reviewed the existing literature on fraud in the banking sector across the\nworld. The literature is reviewed from international journals, dissertations and books.\nNevertheless, most of the literature is available for review and is drawn from experiences in\nAmerica, Europe and West Africa. The lack of empirical evidence in the East African region\nand specifically in Kenya creates a huge literature gap as empirical evidence from West\nAfrica especially Nigeria cannot be used to generalize bank fraud in Africa due to differing\nenvironmental factors.\nThe major critic of reviewed literature is that is drawn from developed financial markets and\ninstitutions with well entrenched policies and systems to detect and combat fraud. On the\nother hand, the lack of literature on the Kenyan scene makes it very hard to provide evidence\nto the existence and prevalence of various types of fraud in the banking sector. However, this\nis not to dispute that banking fraud is present in Kenya, since statistics from the CBK (2013)\nindicate growing cases of bank fraud. This research seeks to address the shortage of\nempirical data on banking fraud in Kenya.\nChapter three below presents the research methodology to be used in the study. It presents\nthe research design, population and sampling techniques, the data collection and analysis\ntechniques.\n27CHAPTER THREE\n3.0 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter provides further information on the research design method used in determining\nthe area under study. In addition, it highlights on thepopulation under review, sampling\ntechnique, data collection method, and research procedure and data analysis method.\n3.2 Research Design\nOrodho (2008) defined a research design as the blue print of the study that provides the\noutline and direction of a research. This study used a descriptive research design using a\ncase. A descriptive research design involves the investigation of a topic with the aim and\npurpose of describing the problem or identifying problems (Kothari, 1985). A descriptive\nresearch design was justified for use in this study as it sought to identify and describe how\nthe independent factors influenced the dependent variable. The independent variables were:\nTypes of fraud, causes of fraud and mitigation measures in place and how this influenced\nfraud in the banking industry.\nThe case for this study was the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA). Commercial Bank of\nAfrica was used in this study as it was one of the largest banks in Kenya, with the largest\nnumber of personal accounts in the country (CBK, 2013; KBA, 2013). Furthermore, most of\nfrauds in the world occur online i.e. through the use of information communication\ntechnologies (Akinyomi, 2012). Since CBA had the most successful mobile banking platform\nin Kenya (M-SHWARI), its inclusion in this study enhanced the validity of findings. Finally,\nCBA was used as the case of the research to ease of data collection by the researcher.\n283.3 Population and Sampling Design\n3.3.1 Population\nPopulation is defined by Cooper and Schindler (2001) as the total collection of elements\nabout which we wish to make some inferences. The population includes all groups with the\nsame attributes. The population of this study was drawn from all employees working in\nCommercial Bank of Africa (Kenya). In total there were650 employees working in various\nbranches across Kenya (CBA, 2013). Employees working within Nairobi County (location of\nthe study) were 204 who comprised the population of this study.\nTable 3.1: Population\nClass of employee Number in Number of Total Percentage\neach branch Branches population\nBranch Managers 1 17 17 8%\nMiddle Level Managers 4 17 68 34%\nAuditors/Risk Managers 1 17 17 8%\nClerks 6 17 102 50%\nTotal 204 100%\nSource: CBA (2013)\n3.3.2 Sampling Design\n3.3.2.1 Sampling Frame\nA sampling frame according to Cooper and Schindler (2001) is a list of elements in the\npopulation from which the sample is actually drawn. The study was undertaken in all CBA\nbranches in Nairobi County. The sampling frame was drawn from various employees in CBA\nas shown in Table 3.1 above.\n293.3.2.2 Sampling Technique\nSampling techniques refers to all the systems and process that a researcher uses to select the\nsample size (Cooper and Schindler, 2001). This study used a stratified random sampling\ntechnique. A stratified random sampling technique was justified for use in this study as it was\nbased on scientific rules of probability, ensured adequate representation of all classes of\nemployees and reduced the probability of respondent bias in the study i.e. respondents\npredominantly selected from one class. The stratums for this study were derived from the\nvarious employee classes who had a direct involvement in identification, prevention and\nreporting of fraud. The strata\u2019s were: branch managers, middle level managers, auditors and\nrisk managers and clerks.\n3.3.2.3 Sample Size\nThe sample size of a statistical sample can be defined as the number of observations that\nconstitute it (Yin, 2003). Taking into consideration variables such as homogeneity in the\ndata, and the experiences of other researchers (Bierstaker et al., 2006), this study utilized a\nsample size of 68. The use of 68 respondents in the study was justified as it was in line with\nthe recommendations of Mugenda and Mugenda (2003) who indicated that a descriptive\nstudy should include at least 30% of the total population. Since the sample size of 68\nrepresented 33% of the population it was deemed appropriate. Furthermore, the sample size\nallowed the researcher to collect data from respondents across the various branches and\noffices of the bank. The distribution of the sample size was as shown in Table 3.2 below.\nTable 3.2: Sample Size\nClass of employee Sampling Frame Sample Size Proportion\nBranch Managers 17 17 100%\nMiddle Level Managers 68 17 25%\nAuditors/Risk Managers 17 17 100%\nClerks 102 17 17%\nTotal 204 68 33%\n30NB: This distribution indicated one respondent for each of the classes in each employee class\n3.4 Data Collection Methods\nThis research used primary data. Primary data for this study was collected using\nquestionnaires. The questionnaire had open-ended and closed-ended questions. The\nquestionnaire format was in three sections. First section had bio data and general questions.\nSecond section had open ended questions regarding causes of fraud and a likert scale on staff\nawareness of fraud management culture. Section three sought to find out if the current risk\nmanagement and fraud prevention processes at CBA had been effective and this was on a\nlikert scaling measurement tool which also enabled the researcher to objectively rank the\nresponses. The method of data collection was used in a fraud research by Bierstaker et al.\n(2006) and they confirmed that it did not affect the statistical significance of the results at\nconventional levels.\n3.5 Research Procedures\nThe questionnaire developed was pretested with five CBA staff. This assisted to detect\nweaknesses in design and instrument. A pre-test had been seen to save researchers from\ndisaster by using suggestions of the pre-test group to change confusing, awkward or\noffensive questions.\nThe actual research was then conducted after incorporating feedback given by the pre-test\ngroup. The primary data was collected through internet questionnaires based on research\nquestion. Data was collected by e-mailing the online questionnaires link to staff in the\nselected CBA branches with the respondents expected to complete the questionnaires online.\nRespondents were not required to give their personal details to ensure confidentiality and\nanonymity. To ensure a high response rate, the respondents were first contacted on phone.\nReminders were also sent a week after the questionnaire was distributed to those who had not\nattempted the questionnaire.\n313.6 Data Analysis Methods\nOnce the data was received, the researcher edited the data by checking for missing data or\nunfilled sections of the questionnaire. Only sections properly filled were used. After\ncleaning and editing of data, coding was done in the statistical software. The statistical\nsoftware used to analyze data collected was SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences)\ndue to its ease of use.\nThe collected data was analyzed using mean and mode which were measures of central\ntendency. Other data analysis techniques and measures used in this study included: range,\nstandard deviations and variances. To analyze particular responses of the different classes of\nrespondents cross tabulation was undertaken. Correlation analysis was also undertaken to\ninvestigate the relationship between various contributing to fraud in banks. Final data\nanalyzed was presented using tables, figures and frequency distributions.\n3.7 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter presents the research methodology of the study. It shows the research design,\ndata collection, population and sampling techniques and data analysis processes adopted.\nChapter four presents the findings and results of data collected and analyzed.\n32CHAPTER FOUR\n4.0 RESULTS AND FINDINGS\n4.1 Introduction\nThis chapter presents the findings of the study on fraud in the banking sector. The findings\nare deduced from the data collected, analyzed and presented in this chapter. In total, 60\nresponses were used for analysis representing an 89% response rate from the respondents.\n4.2 Background Information\nThis section presents the background characteristics of the respondents.\n4.2.1 Gender\nSeventy percent of the respondents to this study were of the male gender, while 30% were of\nthe female gender. These findings imply that the population of study was characterized by a\nhigher proportion of the male than the female gender. This is as shown in Figure 4.1 below:\nFigure 4.1: Gender of Respondents\n334.2.2 Age\nThe respondents to this study were spread out across various age brackets. However, the 18 \u2013\n29 age bracket represented the biggest proportion of respondents (60%). Respondents\nbetween the ages of 30 \u2013 49 were 33% while those of the ages between 49 and 60 were 7%.\nThis is as shown in Figure 4.2 below:\nFigure 4.2: Age of Respondents\n4.2.3 Role\nMajority of the respondents to this study were risk managers/auditors (40%). Furthermore,\n25% of the respondents were operational assistants/clerks, 22% were assistant managers and\nsupervisors while 13% were senior managers. These distributions of respondents ensure\nvalidity of findings since the auditors (representing the largest proportion of respondents) are\nresponsible for the detection and reporting of frauds.\n34Figure 4.3: Role of Respondents\n4.2.4 Experience\nSixty seven percent of the respondents to this study had an experience of less than 4 years,\n20% had experience of between 5- 10 years while 13% had experience of over 10 years. This\nis as shown in Figure 4.4 below.\nFigure 4.4: Experience of Respondents\n354.3 Factors Contributing to Fraud\nThis section presents the findings of the study in relation to fraud in CBA.\n4.3.1 Fraud in CBA\nFraud in CBA is accorded very high importance by the management. According to this study,\n83% of the respondents indicated that very high importance is attached to fraud when it\noccurs while 17% indicated it was accorded average importance. This implies that fraud is\ncritically managed and controlled in CBA.\nFigure 4.5: Fraud in CBA\n4.3.2 Responsibility for Fraud\nAccording to the 44% of the respondents, fraud analysts have the primary responsibility of\ndetecting and controlling fraud. Thirteen percent of respondents indicated that it was the\nresponsibility of the risk analyst while 42% indicated that it was the role of the auditor. This\nimplies that the fraud analyst and auditors had the primary responsibility for fraud detection\nand control.\n36Figure 4.6: Responsibility for Fraud\n4.3.3 General Causes of Fraud\nThe most common cause of fraud in CBA is the availability of opportunities to commit fraud.\nPressure to commit fraud was the least common cause with a mean rating of 2.64 while\nrationalization of fraud acts had a mean of 2.12 as shown in Table 4.1 below. This implies\nthat the availability of opportunities to commit fraud motivated most employees to engaging\nin fraud.\nTable 4.1: General Causes of Fraud\nPressure to Commit Rationalization of Act Opportunities to Commit\nFrequency Percentage Frequency Percentage Frequency Percentage\nHigh 6 10 6 10 36 60\nAverage 6 10 42 70 18 30\nLow 48 80 12 20 6 10\nMean 2.64 2.12 1.47\nMode 3 2 1\nStandard\nDev. 0.314 0.247 0.184\n374.3.4 Weak Internal Controls and Accounting Systems\nAccording to 40% of the respondents, weak internal controls and accounting systems had a\nvery high contribution to fraud in the bank. Thirty percent of the respondents indicated it had\nan average contribution while 30% indicated that it had a low contribution. This implies that\nweak internal controls and accounting systems had significant motives to fraud by\nemployees.\nFigure 4.7: Weak Internal Controls\n4.3.5 Inadequate Supervision of Subordinates\nInadequate supervision by subordinates had an intermediate contribution to fraud in CBA.\nThis is according to 50% of the respondents in the study. Further, 30% of the respondents\nindicated that it had a high contribution while 20% indicated that it had a low contribution.\nThis shows that supervision was lacking and motivated most employees to engage in fraud.\n38Figure 4.8: Inadequate Supervision of Subordinates\n4.3.6 Disregard for Customer Knowledge Rules\nForty percent of the respondents indicated that disregard for customer knowledge rules\n(Customer due diligence) led to fraud to a high and average extent. Further, 20% of the\nrespondents indicated that it contributed to fraud to a low extent. This denotes that the lack of\ncustomer knowledge in the bank led to fraud thought this was to a high extent.\nFigure 4.9: Disregard for Customer Knowledge Rules\n394.3.7 Poor IT Structures\nAccording to 40% of the respondents, poor IT structures contributed highly to fraud in CBA,\n33% indicated to a moderate extent while 27% indicated that it contributed to a low extent.\nThis implies that poor IT structures led to fraud to a high extent in CBA.\nFigure 4.10: Poor IT Systems\n4.3.8 Poor Personnel Policies\nPoor personnel policies led to fraud to a moderate extent. This is deduced from the findings\nof this study. Seventeen percent of the respondents indicated that poor personnel policies led\nto fraud to a high extent, 50% indicated that it led to a moderate extent, 20% indicated that it\nled to a low extent while 13% indicated that poor personnel policies did not have an impact\non fraud. These findings imply that CBA had adequate personnel policies to deter fraud.\n40Figure 4.11: Poor Personnel Policies\n4.3.9 Low Remuneration of Employees\nTo a moderate extent, low remuneration of employees led to fraud in CBA. According to\n33% of the respondents, remuneration contributed to fraud to a high extent, 52% indicated\nthat it led to a moderate extent, 10% indicated it led to fraud to a low extent while 5%\nindicated that it had no impact. This implies that remuneration levels were relatively high in\nthe bank discouraging the need for fraud.\nFigure 4.12: Poor Remuneration of Employees\n414.3.10 Correlation Analysis of Causes of Fraud\nThis study sought to investigate the relationship between the various variables causing fraud\nin banks. The correlation analysis using the pearson correlation statistic show that the\nopportunities to commit fraud and rationalization of the act of fraud had a negative\ncorrelation (-.415) which was significant at 0.01 significance levels. Weak internal controls\nhad a positive correlation to opportunities to commit the fraud crime (.269) which was\nsignificant at 0.05 significance levels. Inadequate supervision had a negative correlation with\npressure to commit (-.543) significant at 0.01 levels, rationalization of the act (-.504)\nsignificant at 0.01 levels and a positive relationship with opportunities to commit crime\n(.319) significant at 0.05 levels and weak internal controls (.499) significant at 0.01 levels.\nDisregard of customer knowledge rules had correlation of -.543, -.447,.611 and .916 which\nwere significant at 0.01 significance levels to pressure to commit, rationalization of the act,\nopportunities to commit and weak internal controls.\nPoor IT structures was negatively correlated to pressure to commit (-.543) and rationalization\nof the act (-0.447). On the other hand, IT structures had a positive correlation to weak\ninternal controls (0.611), and inadequate supervision (0.916) all of which were significant at\n0.01 significance levels.\nPoor Personnel Policies were correlated to pressure to commit (-0.423), rationalization of the\nact (-0.504), inadequate supervision (0.852) and disregard of customer knowledge rules\n(0.870) at 0.01 significance levels. Similarly, poor personnel policies were correlated to weak\ninternal controls (0.326) at 0.05 significance levels.\nLow employee remuneration was correlated to rationalization of the act (-0.682),\nopportunities to commit (0.342), weak internal controls (0.304), inadequate supervision\n(0.852), customer knowledge rules (0.828), poor IT structures (0.828) and poor personnel\npolicies (0.871) at 0.01 significance levels.\n42These findings imply that the factors that greatly lead to increase in fraud in the banking\nsector since they had a strong positive correlation were: inadequate supervision and weak\ninternal controls, disregard of customer knowledge rules and inadequate supervision, poor IT\nstructures and disregard of customer knowledge rules, poor IT structures, poor supervision,\npoor personnel policies and inadequate supervision, poor personnel policies and disregard of\ncustomer knowledge rules, poor employee remuneration, inadequate supervision, disregard\nof customer knowledge rules and poor IT structures. These were the major factors leading to\nan increase in the occurrence and frequency of fraud in the banking sector. The Correlation\nanalysis is as shown in Table 4.2\n43Table 4.2: Correlation Analysis\nDisregard\nPressure of\nto Opportunities Weak Customer Poor\nCommit Rationalization to Commit Internal Inadequate Knowledge Poor IT Personnel Low\nFraud of Act Fraud Controls Supervision rules Structures Policies Remuneration\nPressure to Commit Pearson\n1 .087 -.116 -.244 -.513** -.543** -.543** -.423** -.251\nFraud Correlation\nSig.

In addition, respondents disagreed that at CBA fraud\ninvestigations were undertaken and completed with good time for decisive action (mean of\n2.29 and a mode of 2). Respondents agreed that fraud prevention was engrained in the\norganization culture of CBA (Mean of 4.17 and a mode of 4). Further, respondents strongly\nagreed that fraud incidences were accorded due importance and investigation (Mean of 4.61\nand mode of 5). Respondents were neutral that the organization fraud policy was well\ncommunicated (mean of 3.45 and a mode of 4). Finally, respondents agreed that CBA was up\nto date with emerging trends in fraud (mean of 4.12 and a mode of 4). This is as shown in\nTable 4.3 below.\nTable 4.3: Management of Fraud in CBA\nFrequency Mean Mode Std.

This is deduced from the spread of\nrespondent\u2019s responses on occurrence of management fraud in the bank. According to 33%\nof the respondents, management fraud prevalence was high, 52% indicated that it was\naverage, 10% indicated that it was low and 5% indicated that it was not existent. Due to the\nspread of responses it can only be deduced that occurrence of management fraud was high in\nthe bank.\nFigure 4.13: Management Fraud\nManagement fraud in CBA was mainly manifested in the form of overstatement of revenues\nwith a mean rating of 2.21. This was the highest observation in the ratings on a scale of 1 \u2013 4.\nOther forms of management fraud in CBA in their descending order of prevalence were:\n46understatement of expenses (2.37), understatement of liabilities (2.38) and overstatement of\nassets (2.58). This is as shown in Table 4.4 below:\nTable 4.4: Forms of Management Fraud\nFrequency Mean Mode Std. Deviation\nOverstatement of assets 60 2.58 2 0.045\nOverstatement of revenues 60 2.21 2 0.081\nUnderstatement of liabilities 60 2.38 2 0.066\nUnderstatement of expenses 60 2.37 2 0.059\n4.4.2 Employee Fraud\nGenerally, employee fraud in CBA was high. Though 50% of the employees indicated that\nemployee fraud was moderate, 40% indicated that it was high. This implies that to most\nemployees fraud was on the higher rather than lower scales. In addition, 10% of the\nrespondents indicated that employee fraud was low.\n47Figure 4.14: Employee Fraud\nEmployee fraud was mainly in the form of cash theft in the bank with a mean rating of 1.42.\nOther forms of employee fraud that were highly prevalent in the bank include; forgery of\ncustomers signature with a mean rating of 1.57 and computer frauds (2.15). Other forms of\nemployee fraud present to at a lower prevalence that the above include: opening and\nmanagement of fictitious accounts (2.24), use of forged cheques to withdrawal monies (2.32),\ndiversion of funds to suspense accounts (2.41), and misappropriation of bank assets (2.57),\nclaiming of unearned bonuses and allowances (2.74) and lending to unqualified and fictitious\ncustomers (2.89). These findings imply that the most prevalent forms of employee fraud were\ncash theft, forgery of customer\u2019s signature and computer frauds.\n48Table 4.5: Forms of Employee Fraud\nFrequency Mean Mode Std. Deviation\nCash theft 60 1.42 1 0.083\nForgery of customers signature 60 1.57 1 0.047\nUse of forged cheques to withdrawal monies 60 2.32 2 0.145\nOpening and Operating fictitious accounts 60 2.24 2 0.067\nLending to unqualified and fictitious customers 60 2.89 3 0.145\nClaiming of unearned bonuses and allowances 60 2.74 3 0.174\nDiversion of funds e.g. to suspense accounts 60 2.41 3 0.274\nComputer frauds 60 2.15 2 0.159\nMisappropriation of banks assets 60 2.57 2 0.056\n4.4.3 Employee & Outsiders\nEmployees and outsiders fraud was high in CBA. Thirty percent of the respondents indicated\nthat employee and outsiders fraud was high, 57% indicated that it was average while 13%\nindicated that it was low. Due to the high responses by respondents indicating high\nprevalence, these findings imply that employee and outsider\u2019s fraud was on the higher side.\n49Figure 4.15: Employees and Outsiders\n4.4.4 Employees & Customers\nEmployees and customers fraud was moderate in CBA. Evidence from data collected show\nthat the proportion of respondents indicating an average presence of fraud was 48%, those\nindicating a high presence were 30% while those indicating a low presence were 22%. This\nimplies that employees and customers fraud was moderate in the organization.\nFigure 4.16: Employees and Customers\n504.4.5 Employees & Management\nEmployees and management fraud was relatively low in CBA. According to 42% of the\nrespondents, employees and management fraud was low, 13% indicated that it was\nnonexistent, 20% indicated that it was average while 25% indicated that it was high.\nObservations of the distribution of the findings imply that generally employees and\nmanagement collusion to commit fraud is low.\nFigure 4.17: Employees & Management\n4.4.6 Forms of Third Party Fraud\nThis study has identified the presence of employees and customers fraud, employees and\nmanagement fraud and employees and third party frauds though at differing intervals and\nprevalence. All this can be categorized into third party frauds as they involve a third party.\nForms of third party fraud identified in this study in their descending order of prevalence\nwere: clearing frauds (transfer to wrong beneficiaries) (1.77), card fraud (2.12),\nmisrepresentation and impersonation (2.28), letters of credit fraud (2.43), use of forged\ndocuments and counterfeits (2.45), cheque fraud (2.47) and kitting i.e. use of cheque clearing\ntimes to obtain loans (2.59). These findings are in tandem with qualitative data collected.\n51Table 4.6: Third Party Fraud\nStd.\nFrequency Mean Mode Deviation\nCheque fraud 60 2.47 2 0.071\nKitting (using cheque clearance times\nto obtain loans) 60 2.59 2 0.062\nMisrepresentation and impersonation 60 2.28 2 0.024\nUse of forged documents and\ncounterfeits 60 2.45 2 0.067\nComputer/money transfer frauds 60 2.58 2 0.084\nClearing frauds (Transferring to\nwrong beneficiaries) 60 1.77 1 0.061\nLetters of credit fraud 60 2.43 2 0.048\nCard fraud 60 2.12 2 0.066\n4.5 Prevention and Control of Fraud\nThe section presents the findings of the study on the most effective strategies for prevention\nand control of fraud.\n4.5.1 Internal Control Systems\nAccording to 63% of the respondents to this study, strengthening of internal controls and the\naccounting systems was a very effective strategy towards prevention and control of fraud. In\naddition, 37% of the respondents indicated that strengthening of internal controls was an\neffective strategy towards prevention and control of fraud.\n52Figure 4.18: Strengthening of Internal Control Systems\n4.5.2 Prosecution of Fraud Cases\nForty five percent of the respondents to this study indicated that assessment and prosecution\nof fraud cases was the most effective strategy towards control of fraud. Fifty two percent\nindicated that was effective while 3% indicated that it was least effective. This shows that to\nmost respondents prosecution of fraud cases was effective in prevention and control of fraud.\nFigure 4.19: Prosecution of Fraud Cases\n534.5.3 Tracking of Fraud Cases\nTracking of fraud cases was an effective strategy towards prevention and control of fraud.\nThis is deduced from the 48% of the respondents indicating that it was the most effective\nwhile 43% indicated that it was effective. Eight percent of the respondents indicated that it\nwas least effective. From the findings, tracking of fraud cases was a highly effective strategy\ntowards prevention and control of fraud.\nFigure 4.20: Tracking of Fraud Cases\n4.5.4 Ethical Working Culture\nRespondents were equally split on the effectiveness of an ethical working culture in\nemployees in prevention and control of fraud. Fifty percent of the respondents indicated that\nit was effective while the remainder indicated that it was most effective. This implies that\nethical working culture is effective in prevention and control of fraud.\n54Figure 4.21: Ethical Working Culture\n4.5.5 Encouragement & Incentives\nEncouragement of employees through communication, rewards and recognition was a very\neffective strategy for prevention and control of fraud. This was according to 75% of the\nrespondents who indicated that it was most effective and 20% who indicated that it was\neffective. Five percent of the respondents indicated that it was the least effective strategy.\nFigure 4.22: Encouragement & Incentives\n554.5.6 Remuneration\nHigher remuneration for employees was an effective strategy for prevention and control of\nfraud. This is according to 40% of the respondents who indicated that it was most effective,\n42% indicated that it was effective while 18% indicated that it was least effective.\nFigure 4.23: Remuneration of Employees\n4.5.7 Policies\nImplementation of policies to track employees conduct and background is a very effective\nstrategy towards prevention and control of fraud. Fifty two percent of the respondents to this\nstudy indicated that it was most effective, 42% indicated that it was effective while 7%\nindicated that it was least effective.\n56Figure 4.24: Use of Policies\n4.5.8 Performance Management\nThe use of performance management systems, appraisals and career development incentives\nwas a very effective strategy towards prevention and control of fraud. Seventy percent of the\nrespondents to this study indicated that it was most effective, 24% indicated that it was\neffective while 6% indicated that it was not effective. Due to the high proportion of\nrespondents indicating that it was very effective, this study concludes that use of performance\nmanagement systems, appraisals and career development was a very effective strategy for\nprevention and control of fraud.\nFigure 4.25: Performance Management\n574.5.9 Hiring Systems and Policies\nAccording to 53% of the respondents, adoption of well laid out hiring policies that seek the\nbackground of employees was very effective in controlling and preventing fraud. Forty two\npercent of the respondents indicated that it was effective while 5% indicated that it was least\neffective. This shows that use of proper hiring systems and policies was highly effective in\ncontrolling and preventing fraud.\nFigure 4.26: Hiring Systems and Policies\n4.5.10 Audits\nThe use of expected and unexpected audits was very effective in controlling and preventing\nfraud. This is deduced from 63% of the respondents who indicated that it was very effective\nand 37% of the respondents who indicated that it was effective.\n58Figure 4.27: Use of Expected and Unexpected Audits\n4.5.11 Employee Fraud Schemes and Policy\nEmployee fraud schemes and policies were most effective in controlling and preventing\nfraud. This is according to 52% of the respondents who indicated that it was most effective.\nThirty seven percent of the respondents indicated that it was effective while 12% indicated\nthat it was least effective.\nFigure 4.28: Employee Fraud Schemes\n594.5.11 Use of Hotlines\nFurthermore this study found that the use of fraud reporting centers and hotlines was\neffective in controlling and preventing fraud. Forty seven percent of the respondents\nindicated that it was most effective, 52% indicated that it was effective and 2% indicated that\nit was not effective.\nTable 4.2: Fraud Reporting Centers and Hotlines\nFrequency Percent\nMost effective 28 47\nEffective 31 52\nNot effective 1 2\nTotal 60 100\n4.5.12 Employee Vacation\nShuffling and mandatory vacations for employees was an effective strategy for the control\nand prevention of fraud. This is according to 43% of the respondents. A similar proportion\nindicated that shuffling and mandatory vacations for employees was the most effective\nstrategy while 13% of the respondents indicated that it was the least effective strategy.\nTable 4.3: Shuffling and Mandatory Vacations\nFrequency Percent\nMost effective 26 43\nEffective 26 43\nLeast effective 8 13\nTotal 60 100\n604.5.13 Use of ICT\nThe use of ICT tools such as passwords and firewalls was the most effective strategy for\nprevention and control and fraud. This is due to the high proportion of respondents (82%)\nwho indicated that it was the most effective. Eighteen percent of the respondents indicated\nthat it was effective.\nFigure 4.29: Use of ICT Tools\n4.5.14 Use of Analytical Tools\nAccording to 60% of the respondents, the use of analytical tools to detect and prevent fraud\nwas very effective in controlling and preventing fraud. Twenty percent indicated that it was\neffective while a similar proportion indicated that it was least effective.\nThis implies that the use of analytical tools to detect and prevent fraud was very effective in\ncontrolling and preventing fraud.\n61Figure 4.30: Use of Analytical Tools\n4.5.15 Other Strategies\nRespondents indicated other strategies that could be used to prevent and control fraud in the\nBank. Some of the strategies identified include: upgrading the ATM cards used from\nmagnetic strips to chip and enhancing pins, educating customers on card safety, proper\nprocurement and disposal systems, open door policies for employees, staff training and\ntreatment of fraud cases by employees equally.\n4.6 Chapter Summary\nThis chapter has presented the findings and results of the study. The study used majority of\nits respondents from fraud auditors and supervisors who had the primary responsibility of\ndetecting and preventing fraud. This enhances the findings of the study. The study found that\nfraud in CBA was accorded very high priority. The major causes of fraud in the bank were\navailability of opportunities for fraud, rationalization of fraud acts and pressure to commit\nfraud.\nSecondly, this study found that employee fraud was the most common fraud in the bank\nwhile third party fraud was second. Management fraud in CBA was very low. Some of the\n62forms of fraud identified include: cash theft, use of forged documents, cards fraud, letters of\ncredit fraud and impersonation.\nFinally, this study found that there are very effective strategies to prevent and control fraud.\nHowever, the most effective strategies for prevention and control of fraud are: use of ICT\ntools such as passwords and firewalls, strengthening of internal controls and systems,\nencouragement, communication, rewards and recognition of employees, performance\nmanagement, improvement and hiring systems and policies, use of expected and unexpected\naudits and use of analytical tools. The findings as presented in this chapter are discussed,\nsummarized and concluded in Chapter five. In addition, the chapter presents\nrecommendations for practice as well as those for further studies.\n63CHAPTER FIVE\n5.0 DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS\n5.1 Introduction\nChapter five discusses the findings and results presented in Chapter four. Discussion is in\nview of the findings of this study and those of other scholars and researchers. In addition, this\nchapter presents conclusions and recommendations for the study.\n5.2 Summary\nThis study sought to assess fraud in the banking industry in Kenya using Commercial Bank\nof Africa as the case. The objectives of the study were: to establish the causes of fraud at\nCommercial Bank of Africa, examine the types of frauds committed and determine the\nappropriate strategies for prevention and control of fraud.\nThe study utilized a descriptive research design using CBA bank as the case. The study was\nconducted during the months of February and March 2014 using all employees of CBA with\nNairobi County. In total 68 employees representing 33% of the populations were included in\nthe sample size using a stratified random sampling technique. Data for the study was\ncollected using an online questionnaire for cost and convenience to all the respondents.\nHowever, the questionnaire was pretested for errors and relevance. Data collected was\nanalyzed using SPSS vs. 20 for means, frequency distributions, standard deviations and\nmodes. Analyzed data was presented using figures and tables for ease of interpretation and\nelaboration.\nThe study found that fraud in CBA was accorded very high priority. The major causes of\nfraud in the bank were availability of opportunities for fraud, rationalization of fraud acts and\npressure to commit fraud. Opportunities for fraud were present due to relaxed internal\ncontrols and accounting systems, inadequate supervision of subordinates, disregard for\ncustomer due diligence requirements and poor personnel policies.\n64Secondly, this study found that employee fraud was the most common fraud in the bank\nwhile third party fraud was second. Management fraud in CBA was very low. Some of the\nforms of fraud identified include: cash theft, use of forged documents, cards fraud, letters of\ncredit fraud and impersonation.\nFurther, this study found that there are very effective strategies to prevent and control fraud.\nHowever, the most effective strategies for prevention and control of fraud are: use of ICT\ntools such as passwords and firewalls, strengthening of internal controls and systems,\nencouragement, communication, rewards and recognition of employees, performance\nmanagement, improvement and hiring systems and policies, use of expected and unexpected\naudits and use of analytical tools.\n5.3 Discussion\nThis section discusses the findings and results of the study in light of existing evidence and\nliterature from other researchers.\n5.3.1 Factors Contributing to Fraud\nFraud is accorded high priority in CBA. The management of CBA takes great initiative to\ndetect, punish and control cases of fraud in the bank due to its negative impact on credibility\nand performance of the bank. However, the primary responsibility of controlling and\npreventing fraud in CBA lies with the fraud analyst and auditors.\nThough very many causes of fraud exist in the CBA, the availability of opportunities for\nfraud was the most dominant factor. This study found that the most common cause of fraud\nin CBA was opportunity to commit fraud. Other factors identified include: rationalization of\nthe act of fraud and pressure to commit fraud. Wilson (2004), Hillison et al. (1999) and\nCIMA (2009) had similar findings in their study when they noted that, opportunity is the first\nand important element in fraud .This is the part of the equation that an organization can\neffectively use to deter employee dishonesty through policies, procedures and processed.\n65In addition, the international accounting organization CIMA (2009) noted that some of the\nfactors leading to fraud in banks include: rationalizing their prospective crimes away,\nopportunities to commit crimes, perceived suitability of targets for fraud, technical ability of\nthe fraudster, expected and actual risk of discovery after the fraud has been carried out,\nexpectations and consequences (job loss, family stigma and proceeds of crime confiscation\nand actual consequences of discovery. However, only some of the factors identified by\nCIMA were identified in this study. This is because, while the study by CIMA was\nworldwide, this study was based on one single Kenyan banking institution.\nThe study sought to identify the specific factors that led to fraud in CBA. The specific factors\nwith a high causative effect on fraud in CBA were: weak internal control and accounting\nsystems, inadequate supervision of subordinates, disregard for customer knowledge rules and\npoor IT structures. Of these factors, weak internal control and accounting systems was\nidentified by most respondents as the most driving factor for fraud. Other factors that\ncontributed to fraud though in a less extent were: poor personnel policies and low\nremuneration of employees.\nThese findings are similar to the findings of Kingsley (2012) in his study on banking fraud in\nNigeria. In the study, Kingsley (2012), Wang and Klenier, (2005) and ACFE (2009) found\nthat institutional factors that lead to fraud may include but are not limited to weak accounting\nsystem control systems, inadequate supervision of subordinates, disregarding for Know Your\nCustomer rule, poor information technology and data base management, hapless personnel\npolicies, poor salaries and general frustration occasioned by management unfulfilled\npromises. Other factors identified by Kingsley (2012), ACFE (2009), Cressey (1973) include,\nfailure to engage in regular call over, employees refusal to abide with laid down procedures\nwithout any penalty, banks reluctant to report fraud due to the perceived negative publicity,\nbanking experience of staff and inadequate infrastructure that may include poor\ncommunication systems result to a buildup of unbalanced posting, inadequate training, poor\nbook keeping and genetic traits like kleptomaniac who pathologically steals for fund.\n66This study identified some of the factors while others were not identified due to various\nreasons e.g. they were not identified by this study while some were not included in the data\ncollection instrument.\nThis study sought to investigate how and the extent to which CBA manages fraud in the\norganization. The study found that the CBA has been very successful in fighting fraud. In\naddition, the study found that fraud prevention is engrained in the organization culture,\nimportance is accorded to fraud incidences and CBA is up to date with current and emerging\nfraud trends in the environment. However, the study found that fraud investigations were not\nundertaken and completed in good time.\n5.3.2 Types of Fraud\nThere are various types of frauds occurring in CBA. While some of the frauds are at the\nmanagerial level, others occur due to insider collusion between employees while others occur\nas a result of collusion between employees and outsiders/third parties.\nNevertheless, this study found that the most common types of fraud in CBA are: employee\n(insider frauds). Others occurring in the bank in their descending order of frequency includes:\nemployees and outsiders, employees and management and management level fraud. Though\nother scholars did not rate the occurrence of the types of fraud, they had similar findings or\nobservations to those of this study.\nEmployee fraud which was the most common occurred in the form of: forgery of customers\nsignatures, computer frauds, opening and management of fictitious accounts, use of forged\ncheque to withdrawal monies, diversion of funds to suspense accounts, misappropriation of\nbank assets, claiming of unearned bonuses and allowances and lending to unqualified and\nfictitious customers. However, customer\u2019s signatures and computer frauds were the most\ncommon types of employee fraud.\n67Employee fraud also known as non-management fraud and is usually perpetrated by the\nemployees of the banks (Kingsley, 2012). The main causes of employee fraud are as listed\nabove and supported by the findings of Kingsley (2012), Cressey (1973), and ACFE (2009).\nManagement fraud which was the least common was manifested in the form of overstatement\nof revenues. Other managerial level frauds occurring though at a reduced frequency include:\nunderstatement of expenses, understatement of liabilities and overstatement of assets.\nHowever, these cases of management fraud were very rarely identified. This could be\nattributed to stringent reporting rules and regulations imposed on the bank by the Central\nBank of Kenya and the International Financial Reporting and Accounting regulations. These\nfindings are in line with the findings of Kingsley (2012), who noted that management fraud is\naimed at painting the bank in good light to the investors, creditors and regulatory authorities.\nThough management fraud manifests though overstatement of assets or revenues and\nunderstatement of liabilities and expenses, the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners\nbelieves that it is carried out through fictitious revenues, timing difference, improper asset\nvaluation concealed liabilities and expenses and improper or inadequate discourse\n(Kingsley, 2012).\nThird party frauds were inherent in CBA though at low rates. According to this study, third\nparty frauds occurred in the form of employees and outsiders, employees and customers and\nemployees and management. The low observation of employees and management fraud\ncould be attributed to the organization structure design and reporting stations which are\nindependent. Furthermore, rigorous auditing and risk management structures and systems\ncould reduce the occurrence of management and employees fraud.\nNevertheless, when third party fraud occurred it was mainly in the form of clearing frauds\n(transfer to wrong beneficiaries), card fraud, misrepresentation and impersonation, use of\nforged documents and counterfeits, cheque fraud, and kitting i.e. use of cheque clearing times\nto obtain loans. These factors are presented in their descending order of frequency. Similar\nfindings were presented by Onkagba (1993) who identified cheque fraud, forgeries\n68(Akinyomi, 2012), kitting, misrepresentation and impersonation, counterfeit securities,\nmoney transfer fraud, clearing fraud and letter of credit fraud\n(Onkogba, 1993: Adeoti, 2011; Akinyomi, 2012; Zhang, 2013)\n5.3.3 Prevention and Control of Fraud\nThere are various structures and systems embedded in CBA management and organization\nstructure to detect, prevent and control fraud. While some of the strategies are internal others\nare external in nature. This study however, focuses on the internal strategies employed to\nprevent and control fraud.\nAccording to this study the strategies employed to control and prevent fraud include:\nstrengthening of the internal control systems and accounting structures, identification,\ninvestigation and prosecution of fraud cases, tracking of fraud cases, introducing and\ncultivating an ethical working culture for employees and the use of encouragement,\nincentives, rewards and recognition. Other effective strategies for prevention and control of\nfraud include: implementing fraud management policies, use of performance management\nand appraisal systems, undertaking hiring systems and policies that undertake due diligence\non employees, undertaking unexpected and expected audits and implementing employee\nfraud schemes e.g. reporting centers and hotlines, shuffling and mandatory vacations for\nemployees. Use of ICT tools such as passwords and firewalls, and the use of analytical tools\nwere also effective tools for management and control of fraud. However, use of remuneration\nof employees was not an effective tool for preventing and controlling fraud.\nSimilarly, Gates and Jacob (2009) noted that fraud risk needs to be assessed for each are and\nprocess of the business for example cash payments, cash receipts, sales, fixed assets and\nloans. Given the prevalence of fraud and the negative consequences associated with it, there\nis compelling evidence and arguments that organizations should invest time and resources\ntowards tracking fraud. Based on causes of fraud, we see the most effective ways to deal with\nfraud issue is to adopt methods that will decrease motive, restrict opportunity, and limit the\nability for potential fraudsters to rationalize their actions (CIMA, 2009).\n69Kingsely (2012); Douglass and Malthus, (2009) similarly noted that to guarantee effective\nstrategies of fraud prevention and control, banks are to ensure that operational systems are\ndesigned with inbuilt control devices. Banks can reduce or better still eradicate frauds and\nforgeries if all control devices built into the system are respected. Some of the effective\nstrategies identified include: An encouraging working atmosphere makes employees follow\nestablished policies and procedures and operate in the best interest of the organization; an\nethical culture includes defining principles and values that reflect a desire for high ethical\nstandards and a no tolerance position on fraud. Furthermore, companies should ensure they\nconduct a background check that covers criminal history, education, previous employment,\ncivil history for possible lawsuits before employing anyone, unannounced financial audits\nand fraud assessments, sound internal control, implementing a fraud policy, a confidential\n24/7 hotline, anonymous tips, mandatory vacation policy, use of risk management\ninformation system, use of analytical views and proper password use (Bierstake et al., 2006;\nHillison et al, 1999; ACFE, 2009; CIMA, 2009; Kingsley 2012; Douglass & Malthus, 2009;\nGates & Jacob, 2009).\nWhile all the above strategies were identified as effective, some of the factors were identified\nas most effective. This study identified the use of ICT tools such as passwords and firewalls,\nuse of analytical tools, employee fraud schemes and policy, use of expected and unexpected\naudits, proper hiring systems and policies, performance management and strengthening of\ninternal control systems as the most effective tools for prevention and control of fraud. This\ncould be the reason for system upgrades include the core banking system and the card\nmanagement systems undertaken by the bank during the course of the study.\n5.4 Conclusions\nBased on the findings and discussion of the findings of this study, the following conclusions\nwere made.\n705.4.1 Factors Contributing to Fraud\nThis study concludes that the most dominant factor influencing or accelerating fraud in CBA\nwas the availability of opportunities for fraud. These opportunities were presented as a result\nof weak internal control and accounting systems, inadequate supervision of subordinates,\ndisregard for basic customer and employee management structures.\nSecondly this study concludes that establishment of an ethical culture in within the\norganization structure and environment, research and knowledge of fraud trends and constant\nreview, measurement and control of fraud and fraud systems in the bank are critical for\nmanagement of fraud.\n5.4.2 Types of Fraud\nThis study concludes that employee fraud is the most common form of fraud in CBA.\nEmployees are the primary drivers of fraud through forging of documents, opening and\nmanagement of fictitious accounts, claiming unearned benefits and computer frauds.\nOn the other hand, this study concludes that financial reporting rules and regulations in\naddition to regulatory information provision rules by Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) have\nbeen effective in containing management fraud. This is because management fraud in CBA\nwas very rare.\n5.4.3 Prevention and Control of Fraud\nBanks must undertake all measures to prevent and control fraud. Though various strategies\nare effective in preventing and controlling fraud, this study concludes that the most effective\nstrategies are: use of audits, deployment of ICT security measures such as passwords and\nfirewalls, use of analytical tools, strengthening of internal controls and accounting systems\nand use of human resource management systems.\n715.5 Recommendations\nThe following recommendations are made:\n5.5.1 Recommendations for Practice\nThese recommendations are for policy making at the organization/ industry level.\nFurthermore, these recommendations can be utilized at the practice or management level.\n5.5.1.1 Factors contributing to fraud\nAs per the findings of this study, fraud in banks is driven by the availability of opportunities.\nTherefore, this study recommends that banks should implement systems and structures that\nreduce the opportunities for fraud. In addition to strengthening internal control systems and\nstructures, banks can use ICT tools to reduce opportunities or instill punitive measures for\nemployees engaging in fraud and fraud related incidences.\nIn addition, this study recommends that banks should strictly adhere to due diligence rules\nand regulations imposed by the CBK on customers and employees. This will allow banks to\nhave background knowledge on employees and customers. Where regulations on due\ndiligence are not available, banks should develop custom made bank specific rules and\nregulations. In addition, these rules must be applied without exemption. This study further\nrecommends that banks should engrain in their organizational culture: ethical practices in\nemployees.\n5.5.1.2 Types of Fraud\nEmployee related frauds are the most common in banks. This is through the use of forged\ndocuments, card fraud, computer fraud and diversion of funds to suspense accounts,\nmisappropriation of assets and claiming of unearned benefits. This study recommends that\nbanks should decentralize the multiple functions of employees i.e. employees dealing with\nauthentication of customers signatures do not have access to account details such as balance.\n72Furthermore, employees must be rotated on regular basis to reduce cases of familiarity in one\nspecific area.\nTo reduce third party frauds, banks should instill multiple authentication of transactions i.e.\nmanagers approve transactions of accounts that are dormant or high value customers. This\ncould reduce the cases of fraud especially with the findings that management and employee\nfrauds are very low. In fact, banks must use these findings to their advantage by requiring\nmanagerial level supervision and authentication of certain transactions i.e. acquiring of loans\non postdated cheque/kitting, review or change of details in cards.\nHowever, it is expected that with the introduction of electronic cheque clearing systems and\nthe introduction of EMV chipped cards and Pins, some of the cases of third party fraud will\ndramatically reduce.\n5.5.1.3 Prevention and Control of Fraud\nTo reduce the cases of fraud in banks, this study recommends that ICT should be utilized as it\nis easy to track, easy to use and useful. The use of ICT will enhance accountability and\ntransparency of employees as access to the system is tracked and recorded. Therefore cases\nof fraud are easily identified and culprits prosecuted. Indeed, ICT could be the cure to fraud\nin the banking industry. This could inform the rush by most banks to upgrade their core\nbanking systems and card management systems.\nIn addition, this study recommends the strengthening of internal controls and accounting\nsystems, the use of analytical tools to analyze and present statistics on fraud, use of audits\nand employee fraud schemes to combat fraud. Specifically, every bank must have fraud\nmanagement units where all fraud related incidences are investigated and reported.\n5.5.2 Recommendations for Future Studies\nTo validate the findings of this study, this study recommends that future studies be replicated\nin different banks or financial institutions. This could be undertaken in a large bank\n73especially the top 5 banks in asset size in Kenya or the East African region. Furthermore, a\nsimilar study using multiple banks could also provide substantive literature for comparison.\nThis could provide literature for comparison to the findings of this study.\nSecondly, this study recommends research on the impact of fraud on bank performance.\nThough it is generally perceived to be negative, the magnitude or extent of the impact has not\nbeen examined and this could provide literature on how fraud affects various performance\nindicators of the bank.\nFinally, this study recommends a research on the impact of fraud management policies on\nbank performance. The Central Bank of Kenya, Kenya Bankers Association and the\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards all impose regulations on the type, form and\nfrequency of reporting of banks. This has led to the reduction of management fraud. Could\nthis have a positive effect on bank performance? Furthermore, have the introduction of this\npolicies led to the reduction of other forms of fraud? These are the questions the study should\nseek to answer.\n74REFERENCES\nAbdul R., Babaitu, D., & Tinusa, G. (2012). Fraud and its implications for bank performance\nin Nigeria.

These advancements, one of which is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in\ndetecting and preventing fraudulent activities, have transformed the sector, from improving\ndecision-making to strengthening cyber-security measures (Johri & Kumar, 2023). AI\ntechnology adoption has helped businesses go digital, spot threats early, predict problems,Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 17\nrespond automatically, and improve how fraud is detected (Majumder, 2024; Al-Dosari et al.,\n2024).\nTo a certain extent, banking sectors in developing countries like Nigeria has equally\nexperienced technological advancement in the last two decades, driven by increased internet\npenetration, mobile banking adoption, and customer demand for more efficient banking\nservices (Owolabi, 2020). However, alongside these innovations, the sector has become\nincreasingly vulnerable to various forms of financial fraud, including cyber fraud, identity theft,\ninsider fraud, phishing, card skimming, account fraud and fraudulent electronic transactions.\nThis is because as the sector moves away from traditional banking systems to online banking,\nthe volume of digital transactions has increased voluminously (Metha, 2025; Majumder, 2024;\nEskandarany, 2024).\nAccording to the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), Nigerian banks lost\nover \u20a614.3 billion to fraud in 2023 alone, highlighting the urgency for advanced and proactive\nfraud detection mechanisms. In response to the growing threat, commercial banks in Nigeria\nare turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance their fraud detection\ncapabilities. These technologies offer advanced predictive analytics, anomaly detection,\nbehavioural analysis, and real-time monitoring, enabling banks to detect and prevent fraudulent\nactivities more proactively and accurately while improving their ability to mitigate risks in real-\ntime (Fang et al., 2021).\nBefore now, fraud detection relied heavily on rule-based systems, reactive, and dependent\non manual intervention, are often limited in scope, time consuming, expensive, unsustainable\nand susceptible to human error. These methods have proven inadequate in keeping pace with\nthe increasing sophistication of financial fraud, thereby exposing banks to greater financial\nrisk, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties (Aljunaid, et al. 2025; Bansal, et al., 2024;\nLee, et al., 2021). In contrast, AI-based fraud detection systems offer real-time monitoring,\npredictive analytics, pattern recognition, and machine learning capabilities that enable banks\nto identify and prevent fraudulent transactions before they occur. These systems can learn from\nhistorical fraud patterns and adapt to new threats dynamically, making them a superior\nalternative to conventional tools (Pe\u00f1a & Ortega-Castro, 2024; Jaeni & Astuti, 2024).\nThus, the inception of artificial intelligence-based systems presents a plethora of\nopportunities to enhance fraud prevention mechanisms. AI can detect and prevent fraud by\nlearning from past patterns to identify unusual transactions with greater accuracy, thereby\nallowing for swift detection of suspicious behaviour. AI analyzes transaction patterns with high\nspeed and accuracy to detect suspicious patterns that traditional systems cannot detect or\nprevent (Mediana & Sandari, 2024; Hassan, et al., 2023). AI\u2019s ability to process and analyze\nlarge-scale data provides a good advantage in identifying suspicious patterns. AI-driven fraud\ndetection systems utilize advanced machine learning (ML) techniques involving supervised,\nunsupervised, and hybrid learning models, to detect anomalies and fraudulent activities in\nbanking transactions (Islam & Rahman, 2025; Baltgailis, et al., 2024).\nAI-driven fraud detection systems are capable of making informed decisions without\nexplicit human intervention. For example, AI can instantly flag suspicious transactions, analyze\nhistorical fraud data to improve detection models, and continuously adapt to emerging fraud\ntactics. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency ofEconomic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 18\nbanking operations has gained a lot of traction for improving fraud detection rates, reducing\nfalse positives, and enhancing the overall security posture of financial institutions (Goyal, et\nal., 2025; Al Faisal, et al., 2024; Anzor, et al., 2024).\nWith the rise in electronic transactions, mobile banking, and digital payment platforms,\nfinancial institutions are increasingly exposed to cybercrimes, social engineering attacks,\ninsider threats, and other sophisticated forms of fraud. Furthermore, failure to adopt and\neffectively implement such technologies may leave Nigerian banks increasingly vulnerable to\nsophisticated fraud attacks, thereby undermining customer confidence and financial stability\n(Anzor, et al., 2024; Eke & Osuji, 2021; Ahmed, et al., 2021). This persistent trend not only\nthreatens the financial stability of individual banks but also erodes public trust in the entire\nfinancial system.\nResearch shows that as AI technology adoption grows, it helps people work faster, come\nup with new ideas, and stay ahead of others, especially when it comes to making financial\ntransactions more secure (Narsimha, et al., 2022; Geluvaraj, et al., 2019). Despite the potential\nof AI to revolutionize fraud detection, the extent of adoption in the Nigerian banking sector has\nbeen slow, fragmented, and inconsistent. Several factors may influence the decision to adopt\nthese systems, including level of top management support, availability of IT infrastructure,\ncompliance with regulatory authorities, staff competency, cost of implementation, and\nperceived effectiveness of AI solutions (Goyal, et al., 2025). Additionally, while the bigger\nbanks in Nigeria may have begun deploying AI-based fraud detection systems, many smaller\nbanks may still be relying on traditional or semi-automated systems due to resource constraints\nor lack of awareness (Anzor, et al., 2024; Eskandarany, 2024; Nwankwo & Okeke, 2021).\nNonetheless, security vulnerabilities in AI technology including weaknesses in\nalgorithms, data integrity, and poor implementation can be exploited to commit fraud (Hijriani,\net al., 2025). Anecdotal evidence suggests that many Nigerian banks lag behind in\nimplementing AI-powered systems due to factors such as high cost of implementation, lack of\ntechnical expertise, infrastructure challenges and regulatory uncertainty surrounding data\nprivacy, cybersecurity, and ethical AI use (Adhikari, et al., 2024; Eke & Osuji, 2021; Ahmed,\net al., 2021).\nThis gap in knowledge presents a critical problem for both the industry and policymakers.\nWithout a clear understanding of the adoption landscape, banks risk underutilizing innovative\ntechnologies that could drastically reduce fraud-related losses. Moreover, there is a dearth of\nempirical studies that systematically assess the level of AI adoption of fraud detection system,\nthe effectiveness of these systems in the Nigerian context, and the challenges banks face in\nimplementation.\nGiven the rising incidence of banking fraud and the increasing complexity of cyber\nthreats, it is critical to assess how Nigerian banks are responding to these challenges through\nthe adoption of AI-driven fraud detection systems. Therefore, this study seeks to address this\nproblem by investigating the extent of adoption of AI-driven fraud detection technologies in\nthe Nigerian banking sector, with a focus on key factors influencing adoption, challenges banks\nencounter in their implementation and the effectiveness of AI systems in mitigating fraud. By\ndoing so, this study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the subject matter and\nsupport the development of a more secure and resilient banking ecosystem in Nigeria.Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 19\nLiterature Review\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Fraud Detection\nUsing Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect fraud in banks is becoming more important\nbecause fraud is getting more complicated and harder to spot. AI means using machines that\ncan think and learn like humans to do tasks such as learning, making decisions, and fixing\nmistakes on their own (Anzor, et al., 2024). Artificial intelligence (AI) mimics human cognitive\nprocesses using machines, particularly computer systems. Frequently referred to as machine\nintelligence, AI is increasingly being adopted in the banking sector due to its role in managing\nvast databases of the world's wealth and facilitating information transactions across networks\n(Lukianenko & Simakhova, 2023). The implementation of AI in the industry offers numerous\nbenefits, improving areas such as accounting, sales, contracts and cybersecurity. In addition,\nbanks are increasingly partnering with financial technology (FinTech) companies to use AI to\nprovide enhanced banking solutions during the production process (Baltgailis, et al., 2024).\nAI tools like machine learning and natural language processing are often used to detect\nfraud. They help spot fraud faster and more accurately, make fewer errors, and learn new ways\nfraud happens as things change, this is important because financial crime keeps getting smarter\n(Al Faisal et al., 2024). Banking fraud includes many types of illegal actions that have become\nmore advanced with modern technology (Al Faisal, et al., 2024). Financial fraud in banking\ninvolves a diverse spectrum of illicit activities that have evolved significantly with\ntechnological advancement (Kartheek & Bala, 2023). Fraud refers to a deliberate act of\ndeception carried out with the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or gain. Fraud detection\nis a practice of recognizing a pattern which can potentially lead to a fraudulent activity (Metha,\n2025; Patil & Suryawanshi, 2021).\nLiterature has shown that AI and its implementation have significantly helped banks to\nreduce frauds and minimize them. AI models which run on supervised and unsupervised\nlearning algorithms have helped banks in aiding customer verification, prevention of\nunauthorized activity, handling risk analysis, limiting money laundering problems, and\nincreasing precision and accuracy (Islam & Rahman, 2025). AI has also assisted banks in\nprudent fraud detection and risk management by using technologies such as ML (machine\nlearning), deep learning, and predictive analytics. Additionally, AI has helped banks in fraud\ndetection and risk management by providing excellent encryption, tracking suspicious\nactivities efficiently, recognizing suspicious data patterns, and predicting future behaviours in\nfraud management (Metha, 2025; Eskan\nDeterminants of AI-Driven Fraud Detection Systems\nThe success of AI adoption also hinges on internal organizational dynamics. Top\nmanagement support plays a crucial role in facilitating resource allocation, strategic alignment,\nand change management (Eskandarany, 2024). At the same time, the presence of a robust IT\ninfrastructure and technically competent staff determines the organization's ability to deploy\nand maintain AI systems effectively. Furthermore, regulatory compliance remains a critical\nconcern, as banks must ensure that AI systems operate within the bounds of financial laws, data\nprotection regulations, and ethical standards. Finally, the perceived effectiveness of AI systems\nmeasured by their ability to reduce fraud, improve detection speed, and minimize falseEconomic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 20\npositives influences both the willingness to adopt and the long-term commitment to these\ntechnologies (Goyal, et al., 2025; Al Faisal, et al., 2024). However, bank executives may\nhesitate to invest in AI technologies due to high upfront costs, limited technical knowledge, or\nuncertainty about return on investment. Similarly, regulatory uncertainty surrounding data\nprivacy, cybersecurity, and ethical AI use may further constrain adoption.\nFraud in banking refers to deliberate acts of deception intended to secure unauthorized\nfinancial gains, often at the expense of financial institutions or their customers. Fraudulent\nactivities can broadly be categorized into external and internal fraud (Fang et al., 2021).\nExternal fraud involves attacks from outside parties, such as phishing, identity theft, and\npayment fraud (Nicholls et al., 2021). For instance, cybercriminals often exploit weaknesses in\nonline banking systems to execute unauthorized transactions or steal sensitive information (Ali\net al., 2022). Internal fraud, on the other hand, involves employees abusing their access to\ninternal systems, engaging in activities like embezzlement or data manipulation (Rahman,\n2024; Carter, 2020). Other notable types include account takeovers, transaction laundering, and\nwire transfer fraud, all of which impose significant financial and reputational risks on banks\n(Shirodkar, et al., 2020). These varied fraud types necessitate multifaceted detection\nmechanisms tailored to specific fraud scenarios. Moreover, the complexity of banking fraud is\nfurther compounded by the rise of digital banking, which has introduced new vulnerabilities in\nareas such as mobile banking and digital payments (Wei & Lee, 2024).\nTheoretical Framework\nThe Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) Theory, developed by Everett Rogers in 1962,\nprovides a robust framework for understanding how new ideas, technologies, or practices\nspread within a social system over time. The theory posits that innovation adoption does not\noccur simultaneously across all individuals or organizations; instead, it follows a process\ninvolving five categories of adopters: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority,\nand laggards. Each category exhibits distinct characteristics, motivations, and levels of risk\ntolerance. This model is particularly relevant to the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ntechnologies in fraud detection, especially within sectors like banking that are traditionally\nrisk-averse and heavily regulated.\nIn the context of the Nigerian banking sector, the DoI theory helps explain the varying\npace and depth at which banks are embracing AI-driven fraud detection systems. Factors\ninfluencing this diffusion include perceived attributes of the innovation, such as relative\nadvantage (e.g., improved fraud detection accuracy), compatibility (alignment with existing\nsystems), complexity (ease of use), trialability (the ability to test the AI system), and\nobservability (visible results and impact). Banks that perceive these attributes positively are\nmore likely to adopt AI solutions earlier than those that view them as complex, costly, or\nmisaligned with their current infrastructure.\nAdditionally, the DoI theory emphasizes the role of communication channels, time, and\nthe nature of the social system in influencing adoption decisions. In Nigeria, where information\nflow between banks may be limited and competition high, peer influence and regulatory\nencouragement become critical in shaping adoption behaviour. For instance, a bank that\nobserves a peer institution successfully deploying AI to curb fraud may be more inclined to\nexplore similar technologies. Furthermore, regulatory bodies like the Central Bank of NigeriaEconomic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 21\n(CBN) play a crucial role in influencing diffusion through policies, guidelines, and incentives\nthat can either facilitate or hinder innovation adoption.\nThe DoI theory also highlights the importance of change agents and opinion leaders \u2014\nindividuals or institutions that advocate for innovation and influence others. In the Nigerian\nbanking sector, technology vendors, fintech firms, and forward-thinking executives often serve\nas these change agents, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI-driven fraud detection systems\nand encouraging broader industry uptake. However, DoI theory tends to overemphasize\nindividual and organizational perceptions of the innovation while underestimating structural,\ncontextual, and institutional barriers such as infrastructure deficits, regulatory constraints, or\neconomic limitations that can significantly affect adoption, especially in developing economies\nlike Nigeria. Understanding where a bank or financial institution lies on the innovation\nadoption curve can provide insights into its readiness, the likely barriers it faces, and the\nstrategic interventions needed to support adoption.\nEmpirical Review\nMediana and Sandari (2024) studied how banks use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in internal\naudits to detect and prevent fraud. They talked to bank staff and gave them questionnaires. The\nstudy showed that AI helps make audits quicker, lowers human errors, and builds customer\ntrust. However, there are still problems, such as not enough training for auditors and difficulties\nin managing data. While this study confirms AI\u2019s benefits in audits, it does not explore\ninfrastructural or regulatory constraints that may affect adoption, which are critical in the\nNigerian context.\nPe\u00f1a and Ortega-Castro (2024) developed a cheaper and easier alternative to the current\nanti-fraud systems used in Ecuador's financial sector. They used the LLaMA3 GPT engine\n(with 8 billion parameters) and the Ollama framework, along with OpenAI models like\nChatGPT 3.5 and 4. Their study found that models with fewer parameters, like LLaMA3 8B\nand ChatGPT 3.5, don\u2019t work well for anti-fraud systems because they can't manage complex\nrules. However, ChatGPT 4 worked well with simpler rules, suggesting that while these AI\nmodels can\u2019t fully replace traditional systems, they can complement them, especially in simpler\ncases. This study showed performance limitations of lightweight AI models. However,\nEcuador's financial sector assumes a relatively advanced digital environment, which may not\napply directly to Nigeria\u2019s banking infrastructure.\nBansal, Paliwal and Singh (2024) wanted to find the main factors that affect online fraud\ndetection and explore how AI and human psychology can help prevent fraud in online\ntransactions. They used Matlab and a structured model for their research. Their results showed\nthat there are risks when growing too quickly, and that 3D secure payer authentication has an\naverage score of 3.830 with standard deviations of 0.7587 and 0.7638, along with (CE2).\nHowever, this study provides limited insight into sector-specific or institutional barriers,\nmaking direct translation to Nigeria\u2019s public and regulatory environment less straightforward.\nEskandarany (2024) looked at how the board of directors helps banks use AI and machine\nlearning (ML) and how these technologies protect Saudi Arabian banks from cyberattacks. The\nstudy highlights both the benefits and challenges of using AI and ML in this tightly controlled\nindustry. The results show that AI and ML are useful for spotting threats, preventing fraud, andEconomic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 22\nautomating tasks, helping banks follow rules and tackle cyber threats. However, the study also\nmentions problems like limited technology, unclear AI plans, and concerns about data privacy\nand bias in algorithms. Interviewees emphasized that the board of directors plays a key role in\nsetting strategy, securing resources, and forming partnerships with AI tech providers. The study\nbenefits from insights in a highly regulated, and well-funded context. However, Nigeria\u2019s less\ncentralized tech governance and varying institutional capacity might pose additional challenges\nnot captured by this study.\nAnzor, Okolie, Udeh, Mbah, Onyeka-Udeh, Obayi, Nwankwo, Anukwe and Eze (2024)\nresearched how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly computer vision and robotic process\nautomation (RPA), helps detect fraud in banks in Southeast Nigeria, using a Z-test. The findings\nrevealed that computer vision significantly improved the detection of insider fraud. This study\nis directly situated in Southeast Nigeria and is thus contextually relevant. However, it has a\nnarrow geographic scope and focuses only on RPA and computer vision, limiting broader\ngeneralizability.\nBaltgailis, Simakhova and Buka (2024) researched how artificial intelligence can be\napplied in banks. They examined both the advantages and disadvantages of using AI in the\nbanking industry. AI helps banks analyze large amounts of data to predict market trends, gain\ninsights, and discover investment opportunities, which helps with decision-making. The main\naim of AI in banking is to assist customers by addressing their needs and ensuring they are\nsatisfied with the bank's services. This study offers a generalized overview of AI in banking\nbut lacks regional specificity. It does not engage with infrastructural constraints which are\ncritical in evaluating AI feasibility in Nigeria.\nAl Faisal, Nahar, Sultana and Mintoo (2024) used the PRISMA framework to study the\nnewest AI methods for detecting fraud in banking. Their findings show that AI helps improve\ndetection accuracy, reduce false alarms, and boost efficiency. The review also highlights key\nresearch gaps, such as the lack of standard benchmarks and the limited ability of current AI\nsystems to grow. It also explores future possibilities, like combining AI with blockchain and\nfederated learning to improve security and transparency. While their PRISMA-based review\nidentifies technological gaps, it did not account for infrastructural and policy disparities in Sub-\nSaharan Africa, which affect scalability in developing economies.\nAdhikari, Hamal and Baidoo (2024) looked at how well AI-based methods work for\ndetecting financial fraud and the challenges involved, by reviewing existing studies. They\nfound that AI improves real-time fraud detection and can adapt better to new fraud patterns\ncompared to traditional systems. However, issues like ethical concerns, bias in algorithms, data\nprivacy, and system weaknesses make it harder to use AI widely. Additionally, scalability\nproblems limit smaller organizations from fully using AI\u2019s benefits. This study recognizes\nnoted ethical and scalability challenges and left limited guidance for Nigerian banks operating\nin an evolving, less digitized financial environment.\nGoyal, Garg and Malik (2025) studied the important factors that affect the long-term use\nof AI in banking. They also explored how knowledge of technology impacts the adoption and\ncontinued use of AI. They surveyed bank professionals who use AI for risk and fraud\nassessment. The data was analyzed with SmartPLS 4 in two steps, using structural equation\nmodeling (SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The study found that how easy AI is toEconomic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 23\nuse strongly influences people's attitude towards it, but does n0t directly impact their decision\nto keep using it. However, these findings may not be generalizable to Nigeria, where financial\ninstitutions may prioritize cost, compatibility, and regulatory approval over user perception.\nMetha (2025) looked into how artificial intelligence (AI) can help spot potential fraud by\ncreating a risk score to evaluate account activity. A formula was developed to give a score out\nof 100, and if it exceeds a set limit of 80, automatic security actions are triggered. The formula\nchecks four key activities linked to fraud: logging in from new devices, changing contact\ndetails, adding new payees or Zelle contacts, and making transactions over $1,000 within 48\nhours. The model uses machine learning to consider past behavior, patterns, and real-time data\nto calculate the score. Accounts with scores above the limit are temporarily locked, and\nadditional verification is needed to ensure security, with the aim of minimizing inconvenience\nfor customers. This study is not contextually relevant to Nigeria owing to inconsistent data\nmanagement and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nHijriani, Sahyunu and Kassymova (2025) studied how AI could be misused in banking\nand suggested ways to reduce risks. They used legal research methods, including case studies\nand analyzing laws. The study found security issues in AI systems used by banks and showed\nthat AI could be used for fraud. The findings suggest that laws need to be updated, especially\nabout evidence, to clearly define who is responsible for crimes in AI-related cases. This study\nadvocated for updated laws to address AI-related fraud. However, Nigeria\u2019s complex legal\nenvironment, characterized by overlapping jurisdictions and slow legislative reform, may\nhinder swift adaptation of such frameworks\nAljunaid, Almheiri, Dawood and Khan (2025) developed an Explainable Federated\nLearning (XFL) model for detecting financial fraud, which combines the security of Federated\nLearning (FL) with the clarity of Explainable AI (XAI). With tools like Shapley Additive\nExplanations (SHAP) and LIME, analysts can understand and improve fraud detection while\nkeeping the data secure, accurate, and compliant. The model was tested on a fraud detection\ndataset and achieved 99.95% accuracy with only a 0.05% miss rate. The results show the model\nis efficient, reduces false positives, and improves existing systems, making it a better AI-based\nsolution for detecting fraud in banking. The implementation of the Explainable Federated\nLearning model assumes robust computing environments and inter-bank data cooperation,\nwhich may not be available in Nigeria due to infrastructural challenge.\nIslam and Rahman (2025) explored supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning,\nand anomaly detection by examining how they work in practice. Their findings show that\nadvanced AI methods help financial institutions by providing better accuracy, flexibility, and\nfaster processing than traditional methods. The study also discusses ethical concerns like\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness, and looks at how to use AI responsibly. It shows that\nAI can improve financial security by fixing current system weaknesses. This study relied on a\nlevel of technological and institutional maturity that Nigeria\u2019s banking sector may not yet\npossess. Issues like fairness, transparency, and algorithmic accountability remain\nunderdeveloped in Nigeria\u2019s regulatory discourse, limiting immediate applicability of these\nadvanced techniques.Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 24\nData and Methods\nResearch Design and Data\nThis study adopts a cross-sectional survey research design. The choice of this design is\nappropriate for investigating the extent of adoption, challenges, determinants, and perceived\neffectiveness of AI-driven fraud detection technologies in Nigerian banks. The descriptive\napproach allows for the collection of quantitative and qualitative data that captures the current\nstate of AI integration in the banking sector. Primary data were collected through the instrument\nof a structured questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1)\nto Strongly Agree (5). The questionnaire was designed to capture awareness and usage of AI\ntools, extent of deployment, perceived benefits and effectiveness, barrier to adoption, and\norganizational and regulatory factors influencing adoption.\nAs of the most recent CBN listing, there are 24 licensed DMBs in Nigeria, forming the\npopulation of the study. A purposive sampling technique was used to select 5 biggest quoted\nbanks based on total assets, market capitalization and customer base. This is because the study\nrequires input from individuals with direct knowledge or involvement in AI-based fraud\ndetection systems. The sampled DMBs include Access Bank, Fidelity Bank, Guaranty Trust\nBank, United Bank for Africa and Zenith Bank. Within each bank, ten (10) senior management\nstaff in IT departments, fraud investigation units, and risk management units were selected,\nleading to a total sample size of 50 respondents. This approach ensures that the information\ngathered is rich, relevant, and based on actual experience.\nMethod of Data Analysis\nA simple Ordered Logistic Regression (OLR) model was used for data analysis. OLR is\nsuitable for modeling the relationship between an ordinal dependent variable (like AIFA levels),\nand one or more independent variables (like cost, IT infrastructure, top management support,\netc.). The functional model is stated as:\nAIFA = f(TMS, ITI, COI, REC, COM, PEF) (1)\nThe functional model is stated in econometric form as:\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61(\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4c = \ud835\udc57)) = \ud835\udefc +\ud835\udefd TMS+\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3c +\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc3c +\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc36 +\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc40 +\ud835\udefd \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc39 (2)\n\ud835\udc57 1 2 3 4 5 6\nWhere \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc4c = \ud835\udc57) is the cumulative probability of the response variable Y (level of AI\nfraud detection systems adoption) being in category j or lower; \ud835\udefc represents the cut-off points\n\ud835\udc57\nfor the j-th category; \ud835\udefd are the coefficients of the explanatory variables; TMS = top\n1-6\nmanagement support, ITI = IT infrastructure, COI = cost of implementation, REC = regulatory\ncompliance, COM = staff competency, PEFF = perceived effectiveness, respectively.\nThe choice of OLR is justified on the premise that the dependent variable in this study,\nthe extent of adoption of AI-driven fraud detection systems (AIFA), is measured on an ordinal\nscale (e.g., levels of adoption rated on a 5-point Likert scale). This type of outcome variable\nreflects a natural order but does not assume equal intervals between categories. OLR is\nspecifically designed to model ordinal dependent variables, preserving the rank order of\ncategories without assuming interval-level measurement. The model estimates the effect of\npredictors on the odds of being in a higher category of adoption, which aligns well with the\nresearch objective of identifying factors that increase the likelihood of greater adoption.Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 25\nResults\nA total of 50 questionnaires were given out, and 47 were filled, giving the needed\ninformation for the study and returned. The questionnaire had two sections. Section A asked\nfor personal details, while Section B included questions that were structured based on 5-point\nLikert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5).\nThe demographic information of respondents reflects their professional background,\ngender, and experience of their involvement in the adoption and implementation of AI-driven\nfraud detection technologies within the Nigerian banking sector. A total of 47 respondents who\nparticipated in the survey were drawn from three key departments that deal closely with fraud\nprevention in Nigerian banks. Regarding their departmental affiliation, 40% (19 respondents)\nwere senior management staff in IT departments, highlighting the importance of technology\nspecialists in driving AI adoption. 26% (12 respondents) were from fraud investigation units,\nindicating a strong representation of those directly responsible for identifying and analyzing\nfraud cases. The remaining 34% (16 respondents) were from risk management units, suggesting\nthat risk oversight plays a central role in the integration of fraud detection technologies.\nIn terms of gender distribution, the sample was predominantly male, with 72% (34\nrespondents) identifying as male and 28% (13 respondents) as female. This aligns with existing\nobservations about the gender gap in leadership roles within the financial sectors in Nigeria,\nthough the presence of female respondents indicates growing female representation.\nThe years of experience among respondents varied, with 45% (21 individuals) having\nless than 10 years of professional experience, representing a younger, possibly more tech-savvy\ndemographic. 34% (16 individuals) had between 10 and 20 years of experience, reflecting a\nmid-career group likely to balance innovation with risk awareness. The remaining 21% (10\nindividuals) had over 20 years of experience, suggesting a good representation of seasoned\nprofessionals who bring institutional and strategic knowledge into the AI adoption process.\nThis mix of younger and more experienced staff gives a well-rounded view of how AI is being\nused in fraud detection. Hence, this demographic spread provides a balanced perspective across\nfunctional areas and levels of expertise, ensuring that the study captures diverse viewpoints on\nthe adoption of AI technologies for fraud detection in Nigerian banks.\nValidity and Reliability of the Instrument\nFace and content validity were ensured by seeking expert review from banking\nprofessionals, academic researchers, and IT security specialists. Following Bairagi and Munot\n(2019), reliability (internal consistency) of the instrument was tested using Cronbach\u2019s Alpha\nto assess internal consistency, with a threshold of 0.7 and above considered acceptable.\nAll constructs have a Cronbach\u2019s Alpha \u2265 0.72, indicating that the questionnaire items\nused to measure each construct are reliable and internally consistent. The overall Cronbach\u2019s\nAlpha of 0.87 shows that the full scale used in the questionnaire is highly reliable for analyzing\nthe extent of AI adoption and its drivers in Nigerian banks.Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 26\nTable 1\nInternal Consistency Reliability\nConstruct Number of Items Cronbach\u2019s Alpha (\u03b1) Interpretation\nTop Management Support 4 0.84 Good internal consistency\nIT Infrastructure 4 0.88 Excellent reliability\nCost of Implementation 3 0.76 Acceptable reliability\nRegulatory Compliance 3 0.72 Acceptable reliability\nStaff Competency 4 0.81 Good reliability\nPerceived Effectiveness 3 0.79 Acceptable to good reliability\nOverall Scale 21 0.87 Excellent overall reliability\nNote. Authors' calculation.\nChi-Square Output\nChi-Square test was conducted to examine the association between bank and level of AI\nadoption.\nTable 2\nChi-Square Output\nStatistic Value\nPearson Chi-square 12.59\nDegrees of Freedom (df) 4\nAsymptotic Sig. (p) 0.013\nInterpretation Since p < 0.05, there is a statistically significant association between bank\nand level of AI adoption.\nNote. Authors' calculation.\nThe p-value = 0.013, which is less than 0.05, indicates that the result is statistically\nsignificant at the 5% level. This means we reject the null hypothesis, which stated that there is\nno relationship between bank and AI adoption level. The theoretical implication for this finding\nis that, bigger banks are more likely to show higher adoption of AI technologies, while smaller\nbanks are more likely to fall under low or moderate adoption categories. This may be due to\ndifferences in capital strength, infrastructure, digital maturity, and innovation investment across\nthe banks. Therefore, there is a statistically significant association between banks and the level\nof AI-driven fraud detection technology adoption in Nigeria.\nRegression Model Results\nAs shown results in Table 3, top management support with (\u03b2 = 0.282; p < 0.05) has\npositive and significant impact on AI-driven fraud detection systems adoption. This means that\nfor every 1-unit increase in top management support, the level of AI adoption increases by\n0.282 units, assuming all other factors are held constant. The effect size (\u03b2 = 0.282) indicates\na moderate positive influence, highlighting that management support is a meaningful driver of\nAI adoption.\nIT Infrastructure with (\u03b2 = 0.317; p < 0.05) has positive and significant impact on AI-\ndriven fraud detection systems adoption. This indicates that a 1-unit increase in the quality of\nIT infrastructure is associated with a 0.317 unit increase in the level of AI adoption, holding\nother variables constant. The magnitude of the coefficient suggests a moderately strong positive\neffect, emphasizing the critical role of robust IT infrastructure in facilitating AI adoption.Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 27\nTable 3\nRegression Output Table\nDependent Variable: AI fraud detection systems adoption\nVariable Coefficient (\u03b2) Std.

Authors' calculation.\nCost of implementation with (\u03b2 = -0.251; p < 0.05) has negative and significant impact\non the adoption of AI-driven fraud detection systems. This implies that a 1-unit increase in\nimplementation cost is associated with a 0.251 unit decrease in the level of AI adoption,\nassuming all other factors remain constant. The negative coefficient indicates that higher\nimplementation costs act as a barrier to adopting AI systems, with a moderately strong deterrent\neffect.\nRegulatory compliance with (\u03b2 = 0.178; p < 0.05) has positive and significant impact on\nthe adoption of AI-driven fraud detection systems. This means that a 1-unit increase in\nadherence to regulatory requirements is associated with a 0.178 unit increase in AI adoption,\nholding other factors constant. Although the effect size is smaller compared to other variables,\nit still indicates that regulatory compliance contributes meaningfully to the decision to adopt\nAI for fraud detection.\nStaff competency with (\u03b2 = 0.193; p < 0.05) has positive and significant impact on the\nadoption of AI-driven fraud detection systems. This indicates that a 1-unit improvement in staff\ncompetency is associated with a 0.193 unit increase in AI adoption, holding all other variables\nconstant. The positive coefficient reflects that having skilled and knowledgeable personnel\nmoderately enhances the likelihood of adopting AI technologies.\nPerceived effectiveness with (\u03b2 = 0.226; p < 0.05) has positive and significant impact on\nthe adoption of AI-driven fraud detection systems. This suggests that a 1-unit increase in the\nperceived effectiveness of AI systems leads to a 0.226 unit increase in AI adoption, all else\nbeing equal. The moderate effect size indicates that when organizations believe AI is effective\nin detecting fraud, they are more likely to adopt such systems.\nPseudo R-squared of 73.42% indicates that approximately 73.42% of the variation in AI-\ndriven fraud detection systems adoption is explained by the independent variables in the model.\nIn addition, the likelihood ratio chi-square test of 53.70 with p-value = 0.0000 is statistically\nsignificant, indicating that the overall model is meaningful and the predictors jointly explain a\nsignificant portion of the variance in AI adoption.Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 28\nDiscussion of Results\nTop management support has positive and significant impact on AI-driven fraud\ndetection systems adoption. This implies that as top management actively supports the use of\nAI for fraud detection, it increases the likelihood of the bank adopting AI-driven fraud detection\nsystems. In other words, the more supportive and involved the senior leadership is, the more\nlikely the bank is to start using AI-driven systems to prevent and detect fraud. Thus, top\nmanagement support plays a crucial role in the successful adoption of AI in fraud detection.\nThis finding is consistent with that of Eskandarany (2024) which emphasized the board of\ndirectors\u2019 proactive role in promoting digital transformation and aligning AI strategies with\nbroader organizational goals is essential.\nIT infrastructure has positive and significant impact on AI-driven fraud detection systems\nadoption. This indicates that having strong and reliable IT infrastructure such as modern\ncomputer systems, secure networks, and updated software increases the likelihood of the bank\nto adopt AI-driven fraud detection systems. In other words, the better the IT setup in a bank,\nthe more likely it is to successfully adopt and use AI to detect fraud. This shows that investing\nin IT infrastructure is essential for effectively implementing AI solutions in fraud detection.\nCost of implementation has negative and significant impact on AI-driven fraud detection\nsystems adoption. This means that when the cost of setting up and running AI-driven fraud\ndetection systems is high, banks are less likely to adopt AI-driven fraud detection systems. In\nother words, high costs can be a major barrier to the adoption of AI for fraud detection, and\nreducing these costs may help more banks embrace the technology.\nRegulatory compliance has positive and significant impact on AI-driven fraud detection\nsystems adoption. This means that when banks are committed to following regulations and\nmeeting compliance requirements especially those related to fraud prevention, data protection,\nand financial transparency they are more likely to adopt AI-driven fraud detection systems. In\nessence, strong regulatory pressure and the need to meet compliance standards encourage banks\nto invest in AI-driven fraud detection tools.\nStaff competency has positive and significant impact on AI-driven fraud detection\nsystems adoption. This means that when bank employees especially those in IT departments,\nfraud investigation departments and risk management departments have the skills, knowledge,\nand training needed to understand and work with AI technologies, the bank is more likely to\nadopt AI-driven fraud detection systems. In summary, competent and well-trained staff play a\nkey role in the successful adoption of AI for fraud detection.\nPerceived effectiveness has positive and significant impact on AI-driven fraud detection\nsystems adoption. This means that when decision-makers believe that AI technologies are\neffective in detecting and preventing fraud, they are more likely to adopt AI-driven fraud\ndetection systems. In essence, the more confident banks are in the perceived usefulness of AI\nsystems, the higher their willingness to implement them. This finding aligns with Goyal, Garg\nand Malik (2025) which showed that the perceived ease of use has a significant positive\ninfluence on the attitude toward the adoption of AI technology.Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 29\nTable 4\nSummary of Findings\nHypothesis Description Remark\nH01 Top management support does not significantly affect AI-driven fraud detection Reject\nadoption\nH02 IT infrastructure does not significantly affect AI-driven fraud detection adoption Reject\nH03 Cost of implementation does not significantly affect AI-driven fraud detection Reject\nadoption\nH04 Regulatory compliance does not significantly affect AI-driven fraud detection Reject\nadoption\nH05 Staff competency does not significantly affect AI-driven fraud detection adoption Reject\nH06 Perceived effectiveness does not significantly affect AI-driven fraud detection Reject\nadoption\nNote. Authors' calculation.\nModel Fitness\nThe model explains approximately 73.42% of the variation in AI-driven fraud detection\nsystems adoption across banks. This means that the variables included in the model such as top\nmanagement support, IT infrastructure, cost of implementation, regulatory compliance, staff\ncompetency, and perceived effectiveness account for most of the reasons why some banks\nadopt AI-driven fraud detection systems more than others. Therefore, banks with well-\ndeveloped technological systems, supportive leadership, and a strong belief in the effectiveness\nof AI-driven fraud detection systems are more likely to adopt them.\nThese factors suggest that investments in IT capacity, leadership commitment, and raising\nawareness of AI\u2019s benefits are key drivers for successful implementation. Their strong\ninfluence implies that targeting these areas can help accelerate the uptake of AI solutions across\nmore banks in Nigeria. However, when the cost of acquiring, implementing, and maintaining\nAI systems is high, banks are less likely to adopt them. Thus, high implementation costs act as\na barrier, discouraging banks especially those with limited budgets from investing in AI\ntechnologies. This highlights the need for cost-reduction strategies, vendor support, or policy\ninterventions to make AI solutions more accessible and affordable.\nTest of Proportional Odds Assumption\nTable 5\nBrant Test Results\nVariable Chi-Square df p-value\nTop Management Support 1.23 1 0.267\nIT Infrastructure 0.89 1 0.345\nCost of Implementation 2.15 1 0.142\nRegulatory Compliance 0.56 1 0.455\nStaff Competency 1.89 1 0.169\nPerceived Effectiveness 0.72 1 0.396\nGlobal test 7.54 6 0.273\nNote. Authors' calculation.\nTo ensure the appropriateness of the Ordered Logistic Regression (OLR) model, the\nproportional odds assumption was tested using the Brant test. The global test result (\u03c7\u00b2 = 7.54,Economic Review of Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2025 (June) 30\ndf = 6, p = 0.273) indicated no significant violation of the assumption. Also, individual\npredictors showed p-values greater than 0.05, confirming that the relationship between each\npredictor and the log-odds of higher adoption levels is consistent across response categories.\nThese results validate the use of the OLR model for analyzing AI-driven fraud detection system\nadoption in Nigerian banks.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThis study concluded that the extent of adoption, challenges, determinants, and perceived\neffectiveness affect AI-based fraud detection systems adoption in Nigerian banks. This study\ncontributes to the growing body of literature on technology adoption by empirically identifying\nkey factors that could explain the adoption of AI-driven fraud detection systems. Unlike prior\nstudies that focus broadly on AI adoption or fraud detection in isolation, this study integrates\nboth within a unified model, thereby offering practical insights to technology acceptance and\norganizational readiness frameworks, particularly in high-stakes environments like fraud\nprevention.\nRecommendations\nThis study, therefore, recommended that bank executives should create awareness and\ntraining programs for senior management to understand the benefits and ROI of AI in fraud\ndetection, and include AI adoption goals in the strategic vision and performance targets of the\nbank. DMBs should invest in modern and scalable IT systems that support the integration of\nAI tools; adopt open-source or cloud-based AI platforms that are cost-effective and scalable;\nembrace continuous professional development in AI, machine learning, and fraud analytics for\nIT, fraud investigation, and risk management staff. Regulators (CBN, NITDA) should provide\nclear guidelines and frameworks on AI use in financial institutions.\nFuture research should consider including a more diverse and representative sample of\nbanks, ranging from large to medium-sized and small institutions, in terms of market\ncapitalization, total assets and customer base, to enhance external validity and provide a more\ncomprehensive view of AI-powered fraud detection system in Nigeria.\nFunding: This research received no external funding\nConflict of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest\nReferences\nAdhikari, P., Hamal, P., & Baidoo Jnr, F.

Visa retains the right to require\ncorrections to non-compliant or confusing Merchant data.\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 2Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nDetermining a Merchant Name\nThe Merchant name is the most important factor in cardholder recognition of transactions.\nGeneral\nCorrect use helps to minimize copy requests resulting from unrecognizable Merchant\nrequirements\nnames and reduces costs to Acquirers, Issuers and Merchants.\nThe Merchant name must be the name most prominently displayed by the Merchant and\nby which cardholders recognize the Merchant (while also reflecting the Merchant\u2019s \u201cDoing\nBusiness As\u201d (DBA) name).\nMerchants may sometimes use names that do not cause confusion when viewed at the\nMerchant premises but may confuse the cardholder if viewed out of context on a\ncardholder statement. Examples of such names would include a parking garage named\nJohn\u2019s Farm (that is no longer the site of a farm) or a restaurant named Ship Chandler.\nWhen the content of the Merchant name is inconsistent with the MCC, the Merchant name\nmust contain extra information that identifies the type of Merchant to the cardholder. In\nthe example above, the Merchant descriptor for John\u2019s Farm must be John\u2019s Farm\nParking; the descriptor for Ship Chandler must be Ship Chandler Restaurant.\nA Merchant with multiple Merchant outlets may add the city, store number, or other unique\nidentifier to distinguish the specific Merchant outlet.\nExample One:\nA fuel station is a franchisee of a large retail chain. Accordingly, the retail chain name,\nbrand, and colors are prominently displayed on the forecourt and inside the shop. The\nname of the franchisee is in the window on an A4 notice for legal reasons. The Merchant\nname must be the name of the retail chain, possibly with an added indication of the\nlocation.\nExample Two:\nAn individual owns a taxicab that he leases to other drivers to provide taxi services as\npart of a large taxi company chain. The taxicab displays the taxi company name and is\npainted in the company\u2019s colors. The driver leasing the taxi has his own acceptance\ncontract. For legal reasons, that driver\u2019s name is on a plate on the dashboard. The\nMerchant name must be the name of the taxi company, possibly with the taxicab number\nto differentiate it from other taxis that provide services for the same company. The\nMerchant name must not be the name of the taxi driver, nor may it be the name of the\nowner of the car.\nExample Three:\nA magazine offers annual subscriptions through postcards inserted in every issue.\nAlthough the magazine is one of several published by the same company, the publisher\nis not mentioned on the postcard. The Merchant name must be the name of the magazine,\nas that is the name that was displayed to the cardholder. It may only be the name of the\npublishing house if the publisher was clearly shown on the postcard as the Merchant.\nPayment A Merchant is an entity that represents itself to the buyer as selling services or goods.\nFacilitators,\nIf an entity handles payments on behalf of sellers through an online marketplace that\nMarketplaces and brings together multiple buyers and sellers it may be classified as a Marketplace.\nRamp Providers\nAn entity is a Payment Facilitator if it deposits transactions or receives settlement on\nbehalf of the Merchant but does not sell goods or services to cardholders and cannot\notherwise be categorized as a Marketplace.\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 3Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nAn entity is a Ramp Provider if it provides payment services to convert transactions from\na fiat currency to a non-fiat currency (for example: cryptocurrency), or vice versa. A Ramp\nProvider may sell non-fiat currency to Cardholders directly or provide their services under\na contract to Conversion Affiliates.\nIn determining whether an entity is a Merchant, Payment Facilitator, Marketplace or Ramp\nProvider Visa looks at each transaction separately. There are a number of entities that\noperate as the Merchant for some transactions and operate in a different capacity for\nother transactions. Such entities must process each transaction according to the rules\nthat apply to the type of transaction.\nFranchise:\nABC Inc. owns the franchise for The Ultimate Hamburger. ABC\u2019s name is displayed on a\nprinted sheet of paper in the office window, per government requirements. Everything\nelse\u2014including the large sign in corporate colors outside the shop, the menu boards, and\nthe staff uniform\u2014displays the Ultimate name. ABC\u2019s location is indistinguishable from\nlocations owned and run by Ultimate and locations owned by other franchisees. Any\ndisputes are resolved with cardholders by Ultimate\u2019s head office. To cardholders, Ultimate\nis representing itself as selling the goods. Ultimate qualifies as the Merchant.\nDepartment Store:\nDJS is a department store and leases some areas on its ground floor to perfume\ncompanies that own the perfume they sell. The signage outside the shop is DJS, and the\nentire store is in their corporate design and color. A customer can take goods from any\ncounter and pay for them at any cash register in the store. The customer sees the perfume\nbrand being sold at a unique counter in the store, but they also see unique counters for\ndifferent brands of jeans, which are owned and sold by DJS. Any disputes are resolved\nwith cardholders by DJS customer service division. For the purpose of the test, DJS is\nrepresenting itself to the cardholder as selling all the goods in the store, and DJS qualifies\nas the Merchant.\nOnline Marketplace (1):\nCorriedale\u2019s runs an online marketplace specializing in sales to sheep farmers. There are\nseveral hundred sellers represented on the website, some are major Retailers and some\nare individual sellers. Corriedale does not purchase or supply the goods. Customers using\nthe website can search for a specific item or a specific seller. In each case, the names of\nthe Retailers are clearly displayed along with the price of the goods (which can vary by\nRetailer), and ratings assigned by customers. The look and feel of each web page\nremains that of Corriedale. It is possible to combine and pay for goods from multiple\nRetailers in the same transaction. Corriedale handles the payments for sales and\nchargebacks and sets the returns policy, but customer disputes are handled by individual\nRetailers. Corriedale has in place a process for resolving disputes between\ncardholders and retailers. Corriedale is not a Merchant\u2014the Retailers on the site\nrepresent themselves as the sellers of the goods, and not Corriedale. Corriedale must\nregister with Visa as a Marketplace.\nOnline Marketplace (2)\nSpecialist Parts of Munich (SPoM) is an online marketplace that brings together buyers\nand sellers of vintage car and truck parts in a single location. Sellers must arrange their\nown payments, and often choose to use a Payment Facilitator with which the marketplace\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 4Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nhas a referral agreement. Sellers may choose their own Acquirer or a different Payment\nFacilitator.\nSPoM does not qualify as a Marketplace, as it does not handle payments on behalf of its\nsellers. The Payment Facilitator with which it has a referral agreement is also not a\nMarketplace, as its primary function is to facilitate payments; it does not bring together\nbuyers and sellers nor fill many of the other marketplace criteria.\nRamp Provider (1)\nRamp Provider X is a Ramp Provider that allows cardholders to use their Visa card to\nacquire Bitcoin (BTC). After having their identity verified, Cardholders are then able to\ninput their card information and provide instructions for where the BTC should be\ndelivered (i.e., their digital Wallet Address). Ramp Provider X facilitates conversion of the\nfiat currency from the Cardholder\u2019s card into BTC and sending of the BTC to the\nDestination Wallet Address provided by the Cardholder. The Cardholder now has Bitcoin\nin their digital wallet to use for whatever they choose.\nRamp Provider (2)\nRamp Provider Y is a Ramp Provider that allows cardholders to use their Visa card to pay\nfor items on NFTMarketplace.com, an affiliate website which prices its NFTs in Ethereum\n(ETH) instead of fiat currency (e.g., US Dollars). After having their identify verified,\nCardholders are then able to input their card information and provide instructions for\nwhere the NFT Z should be delivered (i.e., their Digital Wallet Address). Ramp Provider\nY facilitates conversion of the transaction from the fiat currency from the Cardholder\u2019s\ncard into ETH, sends the ETH to NFTMarketplace.com and then NFTMarketplace.com\nsends the NFT Z to the Destination Wallet Address provided by the Cardholder.\nNote: All example names are fictitious.\nVisa authorization and clearing systems provide 25 spaces in which to describe the\nFormatting the\nMerchant name and acquirers are required to be able to use all 25 spaces.\nMerchant Name\nMerchant names longer than 25 characters (this includes letters, blank spaces, and all\nsymbols) will not fit into the Merchant name field and must be abbreviated (but not just\ntruncated after the 25th character). Information in the Merchant name field must enable\nthe cardholder to accurately identify the specific Merchant, and the part of the name that\nuniquely identifies the Merchant to the cardholder must not be abbreviated. This is shown\nin the example below:\nName: NEW YORK HOME HARDWARE DISTRIBUTORS (35 characters)\nPossible abbreviations:\nN Y H O M E H A R D W A R E D I S T R .\nN E W Y O R K H O M E H D W D I S T R .\nIn general, the Merchant name field must only contain the Merchant name, as set out\nSupplementary\nabove. However, there are a number of specific exceptions to this rule in the table below.\nMerchant Name\nNote: even for the categories set out below, supplementary data is not permitted if it\nInformation for\nmakes the content of the Merchant name field confusing or counter to other requirements\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 5Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nSpecific (such as abbreviation requirements). In some cases, the Merchant name may not be\nTransactions truncated at all.\nThe supplemental data must be static and must appear in all transactions. For example,\nif a Merchant outlet chooses to include a location descriptor in the Merchant name field,\nit must be the same in every transaction. Two exceptions to this rule are airline/US railway\nticket numbers and the words \u201cNo Show\u201d, which need only appear in no show\ntransactions.\nIf a Merchant with multiple Merchant outlets chooses to include a location descriptor in\nthe Merchant name field. It must use the same type of information (for example, city\nname) for all its outlets. It must not add the city name for some outlets, the store number\nfor some outlets and no information for others.\nTransaction Supplementary Data Required/Optional\nA Ramp Provider transaction that contains the Ramp Provider and Conversion\nRamp Provider\nAffiliate identifiers must populate the Merchant name field with a combination of\nboth the Affiliate and Ramp Provider name, using (i) the name of the Ramp Provider\n(or an abbreviation), (ii) followed by an asterisk (*), and (iii) the Affiliate name (e.g.\nRamp Provider*Affiliate Name).\nIf a Cardholder accesses the website and/or application of a high-integrity risk\nAffiliate and is then linked or forwarded to the website and/or application of a high-\nrisk Ramp Provider for payment, the name of the high-risk Ramp Provider must Required\nappear in the Merchant name field in conjunction with the name of the high-integrity\nrisk Affiliate.\nThe Ramp Provider name can only appear on its own when it's operating as a\nmerchant i.e., selling currency directly to a self-custody wallet user.

For an in-transit transaction,\nparticularly a plane or a ship, the place where the transaction took place is not always\nclear. Accordingly, the rules specify a choice of places that the Merchant may use as the\nMerchant location for the purposes of a Visa transaction.\nFor other Merchants that do not operate from a fixed location (such as a Merchant that\ntravels between different locations), the location must be either the location where the\ntransaction takes place, or the Merchant\u2019s principal place of business (the fixed location\nwhere a Merchant\u2019s executive officers direct, control, and coordinate the entity\u2019s\nactivities).\nOnly the type of Merchant outlet, and not the acceptance device/terminal type, is relevant\nin determining whether a Merchant is or is not in a fixed location. For example, an\nelectronics Merchant may use mPOS devices inside its store. The store is a fixed\nlocation, so the Merchant location must be the address of that store.\nThe location of a card-absent transaction considers additional factors. The cardholder is\nCard-Absent\nnot present at the Merchant outlet when the transaction takes place, and the activities\nTransactions\nneeded to complete the transaction may occur in different locations, perhaps in different\ncountries.\nA card-absent Merchant must disclose the location of the Merchant outlet (and,\ntherefore, of the transaction) to the cardholder at the time of the transaction. An e-\ncommerce Merchant must prominently display the Merchant outlet country to the\ncardholder on the same screen as the check-out screen or on a page immediately prior\nto the check-out screen. It must not be contained only via a hyperlink.\nA Merchant must use its principal place of business as the Merchant outlet location for\ncard-absent transactions \u2013 that is the fixed location where the Merchant\u2019s executive\nofficers direct, control, and coordinate the entity\u2019s strategy, operations, and activities). A\nMerchant may have only one principal place of business for it and its group subsidiaries.\nIn the case of a corporate group, the Merchant location is determined at the corporate\ngroup level (i.e., as a single entity). For example, this means that a multinational\nMerchant must use its principal place of business as the Merchant location and may only\nuse the country of a subsidiary if that country qualifies as an additional Merchant\nlocation.\nUnder certain conditions a Merchant may also use other countries as Merchant outlets\nin addition to the principal place of business:\n\u2022 For travel/lodging Merchants, where a travel agent does not conduct the\ntransaction, the Merchant location may be any of the following countries:\n\u2013 For airlines, passenger railways, cruise lines, and other travel Merchants, the\ncountry from which the first leg of travel originates.\n\u2013 For lodging Merchants, the country in which the stay occurs.\n\u2013 For car/vehicle rental Merchants, the country in which the vehicle is rented\n\u2013 For taxi/ride services, the country in which the journey originates\n\u2022 For the purchase of travel where a travel agent conducts the transaction, the\nlocation of the travel agent determines the Merchant outlet country, regardless of\nwhether the Merchant is the travel agent or the travel Merchant. The rules for other\ncard-absent transactions in the next bullet must be used to determine the location\nof the travel agent.\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 10Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\n\u2022 For other card-absent transactions, the Merchant outlet location may also be the\ncountry where the Merchant conducts the business activity directly related to the\nprovision of the purchased goods or services to the cardholder. To assign an\nadditional country to a Merchant in this situation, the acquirer must ensure that the\nMerchant meets all the following criteria:\n\u2013 The Merchant has a permanent location where the Merchant conducts\nbusiness activities and where those accountable for the sale or distribution of\nthe goods or services purchased in the specific transaction decide how\nproducts are sold or distributed. The following are not, in themselves, sufficient\nto satisfy these criteria:\n1. A post office box, a mail-forwarding address, the address of the Merchant\u2019s\nlaw firm, agent, or vendor, or an email address\n2. The location of a payments function, customer service function, servers or\nURL, or the presence of a director or investor\n\u2013 The Merchant assesses sales taxes on the transaction activity. Such taxes\nmust be assessed on the total amount of the sale of the goods or services.\n(\u201cSales tax\u201d is a generic term for a range of taxes levied on the sale, and\nincludes sales tax, good and service tax (GST), and value-added tax (VAT).\nThis condition does not apply when no sales taxes are assessable on the sale\naccording to local law.\n\u2013 The location is the legal jurisdiction of the contract that governs the sale of the\ngoods or services (the transaction)\nFor clarity, if a card-absent Merchant (except in the case of direct sales by a\ntravel/lodging Merchant) qualifies for one or more additional Merchant outlet\nlocations, it may assign an additional location for a transaction only as the\nlocation where the underlying business activity occurs for that specific\ntransaction.\n\u2022 Acquirers of digital goods Merchants that qualify for MCCs 5815, 5816, 5817, or\n5818 may be granted additional locations after submitting proof of additional\nrelevant business activity to Visa (including, but not limited to, the location of\nservers).\n\u2022 Within the European Economic Area (EEA), a Merchant may satisfy the criteria for\nestablishing a card-absent Merchant outlet location if all the relevant business\nactivity occurs within the EEA. That is, the activity must all occur within EEA\ncountries but does not need to occur in a single EEA country. When the qualifying\nbusiness activity is spread across multiple EEA countries, the acquirer may assign\nany of those countries as the additional Merchant outlet location. On the other hand,\nan EEA country may not be used as a card-absent Merchant outlet location if no\nbusiness activity occurs there, or if there is business activity that is not sufficient to\nsatisfy any of the Visa criteria. For example, an EEA country may be the Merchant\nlocation if there are permanent premises at which employees make decisions on\nwhat goods are sold and the Merchant pays sales taxes on those goods, even\nthough the jurisdiction for the contract of sale is another EEA country. On the other\nhand, if a country just has a post box, or it is the location of only payment\nprocessing, it may not be used, as these are insufficient to fulfil any criterion.\nA payment facilitator location must be the country of its principal place of business and\nPayment\nmay be an additional country or countries if all activities specified in the Visa rules occur\nFacilitators in each country.\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 11Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nHowever, within the Europe Region, the relevant business activity required to establish\na payment facilitator location does not need to occur in a single country. If the required\nactivity is spread across multiple Europe Region countries, the Acquirer may assign any\nof those countries as an additional payment facilitator location. For clarity, all the\nactivities listed in the Visa rules must occur within the Europe Region, and the Acquirer\nmay assign as the payment facilitator location any (or any combination) of the countries\nin which the required activity occurs. A Europe Region country does not qualify as a\npayment facilitator location if no relevant business activity occurs there or if the payment\nfacilitator does not have a business license there.\nA staged digital wallet operator location must be the country of its principal place of\nStaged Digital\nbusiness and may be an additional country or countries if all activities specified in the\nWallet Operators Visa rules occur in each country.\n(SDWO)\nHowever, within the Europe Region, the relevant business activity required to establish\nan SDWO location does not need to occur in a single country. If the required activity is\nspread across multiple Europe Region countries, the acquirer may assign any of those\ncountries as an additional SDWO location. For clarity, all the activities listed in the Visa\nrules must occur within the Europe Region, and the acquirer may assign as the SDWO\nlocation any (or any combination) of the countries in which the required activity occurs.\nA Europe Region country does not qualify as an SDWO location if no relevant business\nactivity occurs there or if the SDWO does not have a business license there.\nThe location of a marketplace (as defined in the Visa rules) must be the country of its\nMarketplaces\nprincipal place of business and may be an additional country or countries if all activities\nspecified in the Visa rules occur in each country.\nRetailers that sell goods or services through a qualifying marketplace may be located in\na different country to the marketplace. When that happens, the location of the\nmarketplace must be used to process the transaction.\nA Ramp Provider location must be the country of its principal place of business and\nRamp Providers\nmay be an additional country or countries of all activities specified in the Visa rules\noccur in each country.\nConversion Affiliates that sell goods or services via a qualifying Ramp Provider may\nbe located in a different country to the Ramp Provider.

There is no need to determine in which country\u2019s territory the vessel is\ntravelling at the time of the transaction.

The airline is a Singaporean airline. In this case, the Merchant may\nchoose the Merchant\u2019s principal place of business (Singapore) or the place the journey\nbegins (Japan).\nExample 4:\nA cardholder purchases an air ticket from a Canadian travel agent for a flight between\nAustralia and South Africa. The airline is an Australian airline, and the Merchant name\nin the transaction record is that of the airline. The Merchant location is Canada, as that\nis the country of the travel agent.\nExample 5:\nA Merchant headquartered in the U.S.A. hires drivers in Uzbekistan to carry Visa\ncardholders, competing against taxis. Cards are lodged with the Merchant\u2019s app and\npayment is made as a card-absent payment. The Merchant outlet location must be the\nUSA, which is the Merchant\u2019s principal place of business, or Uzbekistan, which is the\nlocation where the ride began.\nExample 6:\nA Merchant using MCC 5817 or 5818 sells software, downloaded through its website.\nThe Merchant\u2019s principals work and reside in Manila. Unless Visa approves an\nexception, the Merchant must use the Philippines as its Merchant outlet location,\nbecause that is the Merchant\u2019s principal place of business. The same company has a\nregional hub in Singapore and a call center in Brazil. Both the Singapore and Brazil\noffices assess sales taxes on software sold. The Singapore office also has people who\ncontrol the pricing and the product design for sales in Asia, and the jurisdiction for the\ncustomer contract is Singapore. The Merchant may use Singapore as an additional\nMerchant location to sell the goods priced and designed there. Unless Visa approves\nan exception, Brazil does not qualify as a Merchant location, because the employees\nthere do not manage the development, pricing, and sale of the goods sold in the\nspecific transaction.\nExample 7:\nA Merchant sells shoes online to consumers all over the world. The Merchant\u2019s\nexecutive officers work and reside in the UK. The Merchant must use the UK as the\nMerchant location, because it is the Merchant\u2019s principal place of business. The same\nMerchant has a regional hub in Brazil for all of its Latin America operations and has a\nlocal management team and call center staff, determines pricing, determines marketing\nstrategy and conducts marketing campaigns, ships merchandise from a warehouse to\nall of Latin America, and assesses sales taxes based on Brazilian law. The Merchant\nmay claim Brazil as an additional Merchant location because business activity is\noccurring in Brazil. Furthermore, because the business activity is occurring in Brazil for\nall of its Latin America activity, the Merchant may use Brazil as an additional Merchant\nlocation for all countries in Latin America.\nExample 8:\nAn ecommerce maple syrup Merchant has its principal place of business in Canada. It\nhas permanent locations in Germany, France, Spain, and the Netherlands. Its France\noffice manages pricing and decisions on which goods are to be sold in Europe.

The Netherlands office\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 14Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nprocesses payments. As the business activity may be spread across multiple EEA\ncountries, and all the required business activity occurs in the EEA, the Merchant may\nchoose to assign its Merchant outlet location to one of the EEA countries in which\nrelevant business activity occurs. In this case, it may choose France, Spain, or\nGermany. Payment processing activity alone is not sufficient as business activity, so\nthe Merchant may not use the Netherlands. It may not use any other country in the\nEEA, as there is no relevant business activity.\nExample 9:\nAn online travel agent has its principal place of business in Australia. Its UK office\nmakes decisions on pricing for UK transactions. Its office in Germany manages other\naspects of the company\u2019s European sales \u2013 deciding strategy and marketing,\nmanaging customer relations, and handling disputes. It pays VAT in Germany.\nAustralian law governs the contract of sale for transactions in all countries. The only\ncountry that may be used as a Merchant outlet location for card-absent transactions is\nAustralia, as that is the principal place of business. The EEA may not be assigned as a\nMerchant outlet location, because not all of the required activities occur in EEA\ncountries.\nExample 10:\nA Ramp Provider has its principal place of business in the U.S. It also has a\npermanent location in Singapore.

If the Merchant chooses\nto use its home country as the merchant country, the country where the embassy is\nlocated must be in the Merchant City name field\n\u2022 Card-Absent Transactions\nMust contain the Merchant\u2019s customer service telephone number, the Merchant\u2019s\nuniversal resource locator (URL) or internet/e-mail address\n\u2022 For the first recurring transaction at the end of a trial period, discounted\nintroductory offer, or promotional period, may contain language or transaction-\nspecific details to help the cardholder identify that their trial period, discounted\nintroductory offer or promotional period has ended, and that the regular price now\napplies for the subscription\n\u2022 Transit Merchant Transactions (MCCs 4111, 4112 and 4131)\nIn addition to the Merchant city, may include a telephone number or URL through\nwhich the cardholder may obtain transaction information\n\u2022 Traveling Merchant Transactions\nMay contain an appropriate descriptive phrase, such as:\n\u2013 SEMINAR\n\u2013 ONBOARD TRAIN (PLANE) (SHIP)\n\u2013 HOME SALE\n\u2013 SERVICE CALL\n\u2022 Travel Agency Transactions \u2013 The Merchant city field may contain the name of the\ntravel agency.\nMerchant State The Merchant state field must include the US state in which the transaction occurred (and,\nfor most transactions, the state in which the Merchant outlet is located).\n(US Region)\nTraveling Merchants:\nWhen the Merchant outlet is in the 50 United States or the District of Columbia but not a\nfixed location, include \u201cXX\u201d (for BASE II transactions) or \u201c99\u201d (for Single Message System\ntransactions) in this field.\nMilitary Bases, Embassies, or Consulates:\nWhen the transaction takes place at a US military base, embassy, or consulate located\noutside the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, include \u201cXX\u201d (for BASE II\ntransactions) or \u201c99\u201d (for Single Message System transactions) in this field.\nMerchant Country The Merchant country field must reflect the country in which the Merchant outlet is located.\nThe correct Merchant country code must be used.\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 16Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nDetermining Merchant Category Codes\nThe Merchant Category Code (MCC) is a four-digit number assigned to describe a\nMerchant\u2019s primary business based on annual sales volume measured in local currency.\nIn addition, some MCCs identify a specific Merchant or type of transaction.\nVisa and its members use MCC data for a range of purposes, including activity tracking,\nreporting, and risk management.\nIt is an important requirement that Acquirers (and their Agents) assign the correct MCC\nto each of their Merchants. Visa retains the right to require corrections to MCC\nassignments and use.\nAny transactions representing the purchase of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) should use\nthe MCC appropriate for the type of item purchases or the Merchant\u2019s primary business\nas per Visa\u2019s regular MCC assignment rules when permitted.\nThe following rules apply to the assignment of MCCs:\nGeneral\nRequirements 1. Select the MCC that most accurately describes the Merchant\u2019s business. The MCC,\nin most cases, should reflect the primary type of business in which the Merchant is\nengaged. If the Merchant has more than one line of business and may qualify for\nmore than one MCC, the Merchant must either:\n\u2022 Use the MCC that describes the business with the highest sales volume\n(measured in local currency) to process all Visa sales\n\u2022 Use different MCCs for each line of business.\n2. Use \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d MCCs (usually ending in \u201c99\u201d) only if there is no MCC specific\nto the Merchant\u2019s business. MCC descriptions are very accurate, and Merchants\nmust only be assigned a \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d MCC when no other MCC applies to its\nbusiness.\n3. Merchants with multiple Merchant outlets must choose the appropriate MCC for each\nindividual outlet. Electronic commerce websites are Merchant locations in\nthemselves. A Merchant generally has only one e-commerce Merchant location per\ncountry, however, acquirers may have multiple websites in the same country if there\nare different Merchant names or a check-out processes.\n4 If there are different businesses operating on the same Merchant premises, each\nbusiness must be assigned its own MCC if any of the following apply:\n\u2022 It operates under a different Merchant name\n\u2022 It operates in a distinct area\n\u2022 It has separate points of sale.\nFor example, lodging Merchants often operate other types of businesses on the\npremises (restaurant, flower shop, gift shop, etc.) with separate business names and\npayment acceptance devices. These other businesses must use the MCC that\ndescribes the specific business operation. For example, a flower shop in a hotel\nshould be classified under MCC 5992 (Florists), whether or not it is affiliated with the\nhotel property.\n5. When applicable, use the unique Merchant-specific MCCs that have been\ndesignated for major travel and entertainment (T&E) Merchants. If an airline, car\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 17Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nrental, or lodging Merchant has a Merchant-specific MCC, it must be used for all\ntransactions related to the Merchant\u2019s core business. For example, an airline with its\nown MCC should use that MCC for ticket purchase, baggage fees, upgrade fees,\nand purchases made on the aircraft. Airline, car rental, and lodging. Merchants that\ndo not have their own MCCs must use the \u201cgeneric\u201d MCC for that Merchant type:\n4511 \u2013 Airlines, Air Carriers (Not Elsewhere Classified), 7512 \u2013 Car Rental Agencies\n(Not Elsewhere Classified), and 7011 \u2013 Lodging \u2013 Hotels, Motels, Resorts, Central\nReservation Services (Not Elsewhere Classified).\n6. Direct marketing and wholesale club MCCs describe how the Merchant conducts its\nbusiness rather than what the Merchant sells or provides. For example, a direct\nmarketing Merchant sells through catalogs, brochures, telemarketing, direct\nmailings, etc. and conducts card-absent transactions. A direct marketing Merchant\ncan sell any type of product or service physical or digital to consumers but must use\na direct marketing MCC.\n7. For transactions via Ramp Providers, when the cardholder is purchasing non-fiat\ncurrency (for example: cryptocurrency) directly from the Ramp Provider, MCC is\nassigned after the Conversion Affiliate business has been evaluated (or use 6051\nNon-Financial Institutions in the case of self-custody wallet load). If the cardholder\nis paying a Ramp Provider\u2019s Affiliate for goods/services, the MCC should be the\nMCC appropriate for the type of item purchased or the Affiliate\u2019s primary business\nas per Visa\u2019s regular MCC assignment rules, when permitted. Also, if the transaction\nis on behalf of another High-Risk Merchant, then the MCC of that merchant must be\nused (e.g. for loading a gambling wallet, MCC 7995 must be used and not 6051 as\nthe nature of the transaction is an intent to gamble not to purchase non-fiat currency)\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 18Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nThere are a number of cases where a Merchant must be assigned multiple MCCs.\nMandatory\nMultiple MCCs \u2022 Automated Fuel Dispensers\nA Merchant that deploys Automated Fuel Dispensers (AFD) must use MCC 5542\n(Automated Fuel Dispensers) for AFD transactions. If the Merchant also sells other\ngoods or services, the Merchant must use the appropriate MCC for those\ntransactions.\n\u2022 Cash Disbursements at ATMs\nA member that deploys ATMs must use MCC 6011(Financial Institutions,\nAutomated Cash Disbursements) for ATM cash disbursements. All other\ntransactions (for example, the sale of stamps) at an ATM must use the appropriate\nMCC.\n\u2022 Manual Cash Disbursements\nA member that provides manual (face-to-face) cash disbursements must use MCC\n6010 (Financial Institutions, Manual Cash Disbursements) for those transactions.\nAll other transactions at the same Merchant location must use the appropriate\nMCC for those transactions (such as MCC 6012 (Financial Institutions \u2013\nMerchandise, Services, and Debt Repayment)).\n\u2022 Quasi-Cash transactions including Crypto Currency Sellers\nA Merchant that sells quasi-cash must use MCC 6051 (Non-Financial Institutions \u2013\nForeign Currency, Liquid and Cryptocurrency Assets (for example: Cryptocurrency),\nMoney Orders (Not Money Transfer), Account Funding (not Stored Value Load),\nTravelers Cheques, and Debt Repayment) or MCC 6012 \u2013 Financial Institutions \u2013\nMerchandise, Services, and Debt Repayment for those transactions even if selling\nquasi-cash is not the Merchant\u2019s primary business. Purchases of cryptocurrency\nmust use MCC 6012 or 6051, as applicable. They must also contain special\ncondition indicator 7 and the quasi-cash transaction indicator in the authorization\nrequest and special condition indicator 7 in the clearing record. All other transactions\nat the same Merchant location must use the appropriate MCC for those transactions.\nMerchant Purchases of NFTs can and often do occur in fiat currency, and as such\ndo not require the use of the cryptocurrency Special Condition Indicator of 7 unless\nthe Visa transaction actually represents the purchase of the cryptocurrency that is\nimmediately used to purchase the NFT.\n\u2022 Money Transfer\nMerchants classified with this MCC allow customers to transfer funds via an\nelectronic funds transfer / wire transfer / remittance (both card-present and card-\nabsent locations including on the premises of the Merchant and third-party agents\nsuch as casinos, truck stops, or check-cashing storefronts) or via an original credit\ntransaction (e.g., via Visa Direct or Person to Person [P2P] payments).\n\u2022 Different businesses in one location\nA Merchant must assign different MCCs to different businesses on the same\npremises if all of the following apply:\n\u2013 There are distinct areas in the location for each business.\n\u2013 Each has its business name / type clearly shown to customers.\n\u2013 Each business has its own points of sale.\nExamples would include a nightclub and restaurant owned by the same company\nin separate, but adjacent areas; a coffee shop inside a supermarket, with its own\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 19Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\nbranding and payment system; a restaurant inside a hotel that is in its own\nseparate area and has its own name, branding, and payment system.\n\u2022 An electronic commerce site with a link to a different website\nA Merchant that links from its own ecommerce website to another website must\nuse the appropriate MCC for each website.\n\u2022 Payment Facilitator: A payment facilitator is a third party. Accordingly, it must\nevaluate the business of every sponsored Merchant and assign the MCC most\nappropriate to the sponsored Merchant\u2019s business.\n\u2022 Gambling\nIn a card-present environment, a Merchant that conducts gambling transactions\nmust use MCC 7995 (Betting, including Lottery Tickets, Casino Gaming Chips, Off-\nTrack Betting, Wagers at Race Tracks and games of chance to win prizes of\nmonetary value) for those transactions. If the Merchant also sells other goods or\nservices, it must use the appropriate MCC for the other services.\n\u2022 Card-absent environment: If the Merchant conducts online gambling transactions,\nhowever, it must use MCC 7995 for all transactions, even if gambling is not the\nMerchant\u2019s primary business.\n\u2022 US Merchants: Lottery and gambling transactions that qualify for MCC 7800, 7801\nand/or 7802 must use the applicable MCC for all transactions even if gambling is\nnot the Merchant\u2019s primary business. If the Merchant also sells other goods or\nservices, it must use the appropriate MCC for the other services.\n\u2022 Multiple lines of business, one or more of which is considered \u201chigh integrity\nrisk\u201d\nA Merchant that has multiple lines of business in the same location must assign a high\nintegrity risk MCC to the line of business that is considered high integrity risk and another\nMCC to other businesses that are not considered high integrity risk. Current high integrity\nrisk MCCs are:\nFor all Card-Absent transactions using the following MCCs:\n\u2013 5122 (Drugs, Drug Proprietaries, Druggist Sundries)\n1\n\u2013 5912 (Drug Stores, Pharmacies)\n\u2013 5966 (Direct Marketing \u2013 Outbound Telemarketing Merchants\n\u2013 5967 (Adult Content and Services )\n1\n\u2013 5993 (Cigar Stores and Stands)\n\u2013 7273 (Dating and Escort Services)\n\u2013 7995 (Betting, including Lottery Tickets, Casino Gaming Chips, Off-Track Betting,\nWagers at Race Tracks and games of chance to win prizes of monetary value)\nFor certain Card-Absent Transactions using the following MCCs:\n\u2013 4816 (Computer Network/Information Services), for the sale of access to cyber lockers\nor remote digital file-sharing services\n- 6211 High Integrity Risk Financial Trading Platforms (card absent)\n- 5968 Subscription \u201cNegative Option\u201d Merchants (card absent)\n\u2013 5816 (Digital Goods \u2013 Games), for Transactions involving skilled game wagering (for\nexample: daily fantasy sports)\n\u2013 6051 and 6012 Crypto Merchants: exchanges, wallet providers or on-ramp providers\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 20Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\n(card absent) with transactions required to use Special Condition Code 7\n1 In the AP Region, Canada Region, CEMEA Region, Europe Region, LAC Region: Applies only if the Merchant conducts\ntransactions other than domestic transactions\nNon-Fiat Currency Acquisitions\nAcquisitions of non-fiat currency (example: cryptocurrency) must use MCC 4829, 6012, 6051, or\n6540 as applicable. They must also contain the applicable special condition indicator, depending\non the type of non-fiat currency being acquired, in the authorization message and in the clearing\nrecord. Purchases of NFTs require the use of the cryptocurrency special indicator (4).\n\u2022Ramp Provider: A Ramp Provider is a third party. Accordingly, it must evaluate the business of\nevery Conversion Affiliate and assign the MCC most appropriate to the Conversion Affiliate\u2019s\nbusiness.\nIf a Merchant or marketplace sells more than one type of merchandise or has more than\nOptional Multiple\none line of business, it must use the MCC that best describes the business with the\nMCCs\nhighest sales volume (measured in local currency) to process all Visa sales. The acquirer\nand the Merchant may determine that an additional MCC and Merchant or marketplace\nidentifier is appropriate for each different line of business. A Marketplace that sells\nmultiple lines of goods may use MCC 5262 (Marketplaces). Visa strongly recommends\nthat the MCCs assigned to Merchants are reviewed periodically to ensure accuracy in\norder to limit potential compliance complaints\nExamples of Example One:\nMultiple MCCs A Merchant sells books, stationery, and newspapers, and also has a music CD\ndepartment. Book sales make up the majority of the Merchant\u2019s business, so the correct\nMCC is 5942 (Book Stores).\nExample Two:\nA Merchant operates a restaurant and nightclub. In the restaurant, which is upstairs,\ncustomers are served dinner; the nightclub, which is downstairs, charges a cover and\nserves drinks. Each floor has its own business name on the door, and they have separate\nplaces to pay and separate acceptance device. The Merchant must use two different\nMCCs: 5812 (Eating Places, Restaurants), and 5813 \u2013 (Drinking Places (Alcoholic\nBeverages), Bars, Taverns, Cocktail Lounges, Nightclubs, and Discotheques).\nExample Three:\nA Merchant operates a beauty salon that sells hair products in the front of its store, and\na day spa in the rear of the building. Both businesses use the same DBA name, and\nboth operate using the same acceptance device near the front door of the shop. Initially,\nthe salon did the majority of the business, using MCC 7230 (Beauty and Barber Shops).\nRecently, the spa has generated more in sales, and the potential for growth is apparent.\nFor this business, the Merchant now has two choices:\n\u2022 Change MCC to reflect the change in business and use 7298 (Health and Beauty\nSpas) as the only MCC\n\u2022 Continue to use 7230 (Beauty and Barber Shops) for the salon, and use a\nseparate acceptance device for the spa, using 7298 (Health and Beauty Spas).\nIf the spa uses its own name and starts using its own acceptance device, the\nMerchant must use both MCCs.\nExample Four:\nA local county government office allows community members to pay for property taxes\nwith a Visa card, using MCC 9311 (Tax Payments). The county also owns and operates\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 21Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 1: Merchant Data Requirements\na ballpark and accepts registrations from the youth athletic leagues. The government\noffice would like to use the same MCC for both situations. Based on the specificity of\nMCC 9311 for tax payments, it is inappropriate for the county to accept the ballpark\nregistrations using this MCC. In this example, the office must use 9399 (Government\nServices, not elsewhere classified) because it is a payment to the county government\nthat does not fall under any other government related MCC.\nExample Five:\nJohn\u2019s Walk and Carry sells shoes and luggage on the internet. The majority of goods\nsold through the website are shoes, so the Merchant must use MCC 5661 (Shoe\nStores). The Merchant may also use 5948 (Luggage and Leather Goods Stores) even\nthough it is only required to use the one MCC for this Merchant outlet. If the Merchant\ndecides to split the different businesses into different websites with separate check-out\nprocesses but with links between the sites, they are now considered two different\nMerchant outlets and must now use different MCCs to reflect the different businesses.\nExample Six:\nA service station uses AFDs to sell fuel on the forecourt and permits patrons to pay for\npetrol inside as well. The service station also sells a small amount of oil, drinks and\nsnacks. The Merchant must use 5542 (Automated Fuel Dispensers) for the AFD sales,\nand 5541 (Service Stations with or without Ancillary Services) for their non-AFD sales.\nExample Seven:\nA Cardholder wants to acquire Bitcoin (BTC). They visit a Ramp Provider directly\nand use their Visa card. They acquire the Bitcoin which is sent to their crypto wallet.\nThe Ramp Provider must use MCC 6051 for the transaction as the transaction\ninvolves the acquisition of non-fiat currency and the Ramp Provider is not a financial\ninstitution. Another day, the Cardholder visits their bank's website with the intention\nof acquiring a tokenized short-term bond. The bank acts as the Ramp Provider and\nthe Cardholder uses their Visa Card and acquires the tokenized bond. The bank\nacting as the Ramp Provider must use MCC 6012 as the transaction involves the\nacquisition of non-fiat currency and the bank is a financial institution.\nExample Eight:\nA Cardholder visits a Ramp Provider to acquire Solana (SOL). They use their Visa\ncard, acquire the Solana with intent to load a general-purpose crypto wallet. The\nRamp Provider must use MCC 6051 as the transaction involves the acquisition of\nnon-fiat currency and it is not a financial institution. Another day, the Cardholder\nvisits another Ramp Provider to acquire Ethereum with intent to gamble. The\nCardholder uses their Visa card with the Ramp Provider who has an Affiliate where\nthey send the Ethereum to in order to complete the Cardholder's transaction. The\nRamp Provider must use the MCC that best describes the Affiliate's primary\nbusiness as the Cardholder is paying the Affiliate for goods/services (e.g., in this\ncase MCC 7995)\nApril 2025 VISA PUBLIC 22Merchant Data Standards Manual Section 2: Merchant Category Code Listing\nSection 2: Merchant Category Code Listing\nMCCs are listed in numeric order with a full definition for each MCC.\nThe MCCs and descriptions have been derived from Standard Industrial Classification\n(SIC) Codes and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Codes.

      "text": "Fraud and Corruption Case Studies sent in by Councils\n1) Mandate Fraud\nAttempted mandate fraud from a fraudster pretending to be a local care home. This was prevented\nas a result of the procedures in place at the Council to carry out an independent verification of the\nrequest to change bank account details.\n2) Collusion with supplier\nWhat happened?\nEmail records suggested an officer was involved in colluding with a contractor to bid and win council\ncontracts, the officer denied any financial gain.\nHow was this discovered?\nAllegations were made that a Manager had incorrectly claimed expenses and was frequently absent\nat external meetings, which prompted a review of emails as part of the investigation.\nDetails\nThe emails uncovered:\na) completion of preliminary costing of works for the contractor to win work with several\norganisations unrelated to the Council but not declared by the Officer as part of their undeclared\nprivate work;\nb) assistance provided to the contractors in submitting a quote for a Council tender by forwarding a\ncompetitor\u2019s completed tender submission document and advising the Contractor to submit a\nslightly lower quote in order win the work; the officer due to his position had access to the other\nbids received, (in light of this investigation the tender valued at \u00a315k was withdrawn).\nc) discussions regarding payment for work carried out by the Officer on behalf of the Contractor.\nd) advising on bids and assisting and contracts and then involved in the tender appraisal and\nawarding process and not declaring this.\nConclusion\nIt was concluded that the Officer had engaged in inappropriate business relationships which not only\nresulted in a Contractor/Supplier gaining an unfair advantage during the bidding process, an\nimpression was created that a Council Officer could be improperly influenced, the matter was\nreferred to the Police.3) Collusion with suppliers\nWhat happened?\nA senior officer within the Education Department was responsible for developing a tender document\nfor school improvement services. The partners of both the senior officer and her direct line manager\nwere established providers of school improvement services. A conflict of interest was not declared\nby either employee, nor avoided/appropriately managed, therefore giving them the opportunity to\nwrite the tender to favour certain providers (or indeed preclude others).\nHow did this come to light?\nThe issue came to light when incoming tenders were scrutinised by commissioning support officers \u2013\nironically the conflicts of interest had been declared by the individuals bidding for the work which\nled to alarm bells given that the \u2018connected\u2019 employees had significant influence over the tender\nprocess and, ultimately, the award of the work.\nConclusions\nThe whole tender was pulled due to the risk of legal challenge from other providers of these types of\nservices who may have felt precluded at initial tendering stage if tender specification had been\nunfairly written.\n4) Payment card abuse facilitated by lack of management oversight\nWhat happened?\nA trusted and long serving member of staff within a very busy department had been issued with a\npayment card to assist in their duties. They had held an organisational credit card for several years\nand were highly trusted by management.\nThe job was pressurised and in part ensured that emergency accommodation was supplied to those\nin need, involving some of the most vulnerable in our society.\nThe managers of this individual did not properly check payments as they felt that they did not have\nenough time, the process for the managers involved checking an e-mail containing all transactions\nfrom members of staff with a card and going into the system and ensuring that the correct\npaperwork had been supplied in connection with the spend.\nAs a result of these perceived pressures and the fact that staff were \u2018trusted\u2019 the managers were\nskim reading the e-mail, and as long as it looked \u201cOK\u201d, they would authorise all payments.\nHow was this discovered?\nFollowing a recent change in manager, anomalous transactions were picked up that in the words of\nthe new manager \u201cdidn\u2019t look right\u201d, the matter was only then referred to the Counter Fraud\nServices Team.\nConclusions\nFollowing an investigation, it was established that there were well over 100 personal transactions\nfound over a two-year period which included multiple holidays for the individual and family, as well\nas garage payments for their car being repaired and serviced.\nThe value of the illegal transactions uncovered was around \u00a38,500.The managers were not following the council\u2019s process on corporate credit card usage, had they\nbeen following the correct process, the misuse would have been detected earlier, or it would have\nmade it too hard a crime to commit in the first place.\nThe officer concerned has been dismissed through the disciplinary process and based upon current\nevidence a prosecution will follow shortly for over 100 Section 4 Fraud Act 2006 offences, at least 10\nSection 2 offences under the same Act and 5 offences contrary to Section 1 of the Forgery and\nCounterfeiting Act 1981.\n5) Collusion with supplier\nWhat happened?\nIn the Council\u2019s road resurfacing programme, the contractor\u2019s Contract Manager and the council\u2019s\nPrincipal Engineer (responsible for the resurfacing programme) colluded over a two-and-a-half-year\nperiod to defraud the council. Approximately 110 resurfacing jobs were vastly overcharged, with\nsurface areas being overstated by anything up to 40% with the appropriate overcharging for\nmaterials; the number of days the jobs took was overstated; overstating of the amount of lineage\n(for parking bays etc) that had to be painted back on to the new surface \u2013 an example of this is a\nroad that is not much more than 100 metres long where they claimed to have put down 3 kilometres\nof lineage. One of the bigger areas of overcharging was claims for disposal of old surfaces that they\nclaimed contained tar contaminates (this type of material has to be chemically treated and hence\ncosts a lot more to dispose of than uncontaminated material) when checks showed that the material\nwas not contaminated.\nThis overcharging amounted to \u00a31.9 million.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe contractor received a whistleblowing complaint about the activities of their Contract Manager\nand employed an external firm of investigators to undertake a full review. This highlighted the work\ndone on the Principal Engineer\u2019s house (\u00a340,000 incorporated into road resurfacing jobs) and a boat\nclub (where the Principal Engineer subsequently got married). The contractor contacted the council\nabout their findings and then the council undertook a full review of all road resurfacing jobs\nundertaken over the last few years, this highlighted the full extent of the fraud.\nConclusions\nThe majority of the money was taken from the system either by the contractor\u2019s Contract Manager\ncreating \u201cghost\u201d sub-contractors who supposedly worked on the jobs, or genuine sub-contractors\nclaiming for work not undertaken (in collusion with the Contract Manager). The money then appears\nto have been cashed and distributed to the relevant parties.\n6) Training Provider - Lack of effective due diligence\nWhat happened?\nAs part of an employment scheme the Council wanted to send 10 residents on an Asbestos Course to\nenable their employment with a local company requiring qualified personnel. The employment\nteam arranged a course for the residents through a provider. It later transpired that the Consultant\nengaged to provide the training from the provider was not appropriately qualified and was also the\npartner of the person at the Council arranging the training. Furthermore, the consultant was listed\nas a \u2018Disqualified Director\u2019 on Companies\u2019 House. The Company proposed a second Consultant, whoalso proved to be unqualified for the training he was required to deliver. The Company itself was\nalso not registered to provide the Asbestos training as required by UK Law and had used another\nsimilar provider\u2019s details together with their VAT Registration Number when they were set up on the\nfinance system as a new supplier.\nHow was this discovered?\nAudit and Assurance services decided to check the company that was being used to provide the\ntraining and passed the Consultant\u2019s details to the Council\u2019s in-house asbestos manager for\nverification. Further investigation carried out by the Audit and Assurance team brought to light the\nadditional facts referred to above.\nConclusions\nLessons learnt:\nAdditional information and checks for new businesses should include checking the VAT Registration\nNumber where applicable.\nService areas were advised to revise their procedures to carry out a \u2018Credit Check\u2019 on new business\nproviders to ensure they are fit for purpose to carry out any future required training.\nIf this company had carried out the training, then the Council would be severely at fault for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\u2022 Using a company that was not registered in the UK to carry out the asbestos training.\n\u2022 The training would have been delivered by an unqualified person.\n\u2022 The certificate issued at the end of the training would not be fit-for-purpose.\n\u2022 If any of the ten local residents who had completed the training then went on site, and had\nan accident, then the Council would be held partly responsible, which may result in an insurance\nclaim against the Council either by the person doing the asbestos work or the person(s) who the\nwork was being carried out for.\n7) Case study \u2013 abuse of position\nWhat happened?\nAn Interim Manager in the Council\u2019s Transport and Vehicle\u2019s department, hired vehicles for personal\nuse (or use by his girlfriend) covering at least nine different vehicles, totalling over \u00a318,000. In each\ninstance the individual\u2019s name was used as the purchase order reference, rather than the Council\u2019s\nname, outside usual procedure. The individual was able to secure approval and payment for these\nthrough the Council\u2019s system, by persuading other managers and staff members to approve and\nprocess invoices.\nThe individual hired numerous pieces of machinery on separate occasions, totalling over \u00a34,000\nfrom one company. One of these items was reported stolen from a Council site where it should not\nhave been located. The Interim Manager failed to inform the Council\u2019s insurance team of the theft,\nwhich meant the Council paid over \u00a36,500 to cover the stolen machinery.Further equipment was hired from a second hire company, totalling \u00a31,400 and the Interim Manager\nprovided a fake order number to the company. This second hire company was never an authorised\nsupplier for the Council.\nThe Interim Manager arranged for invoices to be paid to a Gardening Company with the same\naddress as their residential address and using a bank account that was the same as the account for\ntheir salary. The first payment was for over \u00a37,400. The interim manager then chased a different\nteam within the Council, for a further payment of over \u00a311,300 on behalf of the Gardening company.\nThe Council paid over \u00a320,700 to the Interim Manger\u2019s account. The work was actually carried out by\nanother company at the request of the Interim Manager.\nThe Interim Manager asked their manager to process a payment using their corporate credit card, as\nthe supplier was allegedly chasing payment of nearly \u00a31,000 and no one was available to process the\npurchase order. These goods were ordered by the Interim Manager and were never located.\nThe Interim Manager managed to negotiate compensation from a supplier who had delayed in\nproviding equipment. This sum of \u00a34,000 was paid directly to the Interim Manager\u2019s bank account.\nIn total the Interim Manager\u2019s actions resulted in monies, goods or services with a total value of\n\u00a360,882.16 being ordered or obtained at a cost to the Council from seven suppliers, including the\nfalse invoices purporting to be from the Gardening Company.\nThirty-one fraudulent invoices were introduced by the Interim Manager totalling over \u00a348,000 and\nwere processed, authorised and paid using the Council\u2019s systems. At no time did the officers\nauthorising the transactions have sight of the invoices. A further eight invoices totalling more than\n\u00a37,000 were subsequently authorised by the Interim Manager\u2019s Line Manager due to liabilities\nincurred by the Interim Manager. Employee purchase cards were used to pay for goods worth over\n\u00a31,270 and the Interim Manager personally benefitted by \u00a34,000 from the compensation payment\nand over \u00a320,780 from the fraudulent invoices he submitted from the Gardening company.\nHow was it discovered?\nFollowing a whistleblowing referral to Audit services relating to another matter, enquiries were\nmade which identified concerns regarding the actions of an Interim Manager in the Transport and\nVehicles department.\nConclusions\nAs an interim employee, the Interim Manager did not have budgetary responsibility or authority and\ninstead used his influence to request that other managers and staff raised and approved invoices on\nhis behalf. At the end of the month these were transferred over to the maintenance cost centre. The\nother staff members were acting outside of the policies and procedures in place and appropriate\ndisciplinary action has been taken.\nThe Interim Manager secured the role with fraudulent references and a fraudulent qualification\ndocument. A thorough reference check would have revealed the individual was a serial fraudster\nand was not appropriately qualified. This led to the Council operating in breach of their Goods\nVehicle Operator\u2019s Licence. The reference checks were outsourced to the recruitment company that\nfound the Interim Manager.The Council\u2019s investigation found that the maintenance company with the same bank account as the\nInterim Manager\u2019s company did not exist and was set up on the Councils system using another\nsupplier\u2019s VAT number.\nAn investigation was led by the Council\u2019s Audit Services department, who jointly worked with the\npolice to take the matter to Birmingham Crown Court where the Interim Manager pleaded guilty to\nFraud Act Offences on 29/4/19. He received a three-year custodial sentence 17 July 2019.\n8) Supplier submitted fraudulent reports\nWhat happened?\nA commissioned provider of public health stop smoking services to a Council was amending data to\nmaximise payments due to it under a payments-by-results contract. In short, the provider was paid\nan amount for every individual that progressed along a stop smoking journey. Data relating to\npeople dropping out was amended to falsely represent that they had successfully completed the\nstop smoking programme and therefore attracted a payment for completion of the programme.\nOverpayments totalled \u00a3140k. The Company refunded the overpayment in full, blaming a rogue\nsenior employee who was subsequently dismissed and reported to the Police. The motive for the\nfraud is unclear, the Police feeling it was simply to enhance their reputation as a well-respected\nacademic lead in this field.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe fraud came to light when the Council took a business decision to bring the service back \u2018in\nhouse\u2019. A number of staff were subject to TUPE transfer from the provider to the Council and these\nstaff then shared concerns with Council management at the point of transfer.\nConclusions\nThe control environment failed in a number of areas, including:\n\u2022 Ineffective contract monitoring, with provider data being taken at face value with no dip\nsampling at service user level to validate the accuracy of the data submitted\n\u2022 Contract overperformance, i.e. as a result of data manipulation, being seen by the Council as\na good thing, leading to relaxed contract monitoring, rather than raising any alarm bells\n\u2022 Poor controls at provider level enabling provider senior staff to retrospectively amend\nservice user level data\n9) School Payment Fraud\nWhat happened?\nA School Finance Officer was amending supplier bank account details to divert genuine payments\ninto their own account. Immediately after the processing of the BACS run the details were corrected\nagain. The total estimated fraud loss was \u00a380,000.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe issue was identified when genuine suppliers began to chase payment of outstanding invoices.Conclusions\nThe control environment failed in the following areas:\n\u2022 An officer involved in the payment process had the system access to be able to amend\nsupplier bank account details (i.e. limited segregation of duties)\n\u2022 There was no independent review of system audit trails. These were available and would\nhave shown clearly a number of transactions amending (and changing back again) supplier\nbank details.\nTo note, if the individual had also fabricated false invoices as opposed to diverting payment of\ngenuine invoices, this could have gone undetected.\n10) Collusion between staff and supplier - Overcharging for high volume, low value items\nWhat happened?\nA company was set up by a businessman in his wife\u2019s name and used to overcharge the Council\u2019s\nhighways department for a large number of low value items, such as cutting blades, black sacks and\ntool containers. A stores controller in the council\u2019s highways depot, deliberately placed orders with\nthe company. The store controller\u2019s wife was named as a Director of the Company. The businessman\nwas jailed for two years and the stores controller for three years, for defrauding the Council out of\n\u00a3100,000. The two women received suspended sentences.\nHow was this discovered?\nThis was discovered when a new commercial and logistics manager started and found orders they\nhad not signed off.\nConclusions:\nThis situation displays many of the elements to enable the fraud to occur:\n\u2022 Husband and wife employed at same location leading to fraud opportunity through collusion\n\u2022 Conflicts of interest \u2013 employees becoming directors of a supplier\n\u2022 Poor internal controls, e.g. authorisation of orders, validation of prices\n\u2022 Poor value-for-money\n\u2022 Poor budget monitoring\n\u2022 Over-specification\n\u2022 Overpricing\n11) Bus operator inflating claims for concessionary passes\nWhat happened?\nOne bus operator (Operator A) was inflating claims for concessionary passes, which were\nreimbursed to the operator at a fixed amount. The operator had no smart card readers on the buses\nso was relying on manual recording by bus drivers. Reports submitted were then inflated, so roseexponentially over time. This was 'hidden' as the reports were provided in aggregate with other\nproviders in the area. An estimate of the amount overcharged was \u00a31.5 million over three years.\nHow was this discovered?\nOne of the other operators raised a query with the administering authority in relation to the\nproportion of the total concessionary fare reimbursement that they were receiving. This led the\nadministering authority to identify the amounts reimbursed to Operator A had increased\nexponentially over the previous two years and were out of all proportion to the level of claims that\nwould be expected for the two routes that the operator ran.\nConclusions\nThe administering authority was supposed to have an audit / checking regime in place to ensure that\noperators only claimed for valid, qualifying journeys. This should have included spot checks on a\nsample of journeys, plus analytical review of trends in claims.\nThis case highlights the risk of not enforcing all terms of a contract (in this case, the other authorities\nhad not picked up that the administering authority had stopped doing spot checks, because of\nfunding cuts). In addition, the fact that Operator A was being overpaid was masked because the\nadministering authority issued a consolidated invoice quarterly to cover its reimbursement of all\noperators.\n12) Fraud by abuse of position \u2013 hidden fees (this is historic 2009-20101)\nWhat happened?\nA procurement manager responsible for buying energy in bulk for more than 120 public sector\nbodies, secretly negotiated extra fees with a supplier and had these paid over to an account he\nowned. The supplier believed these fees were going to the Council. A total of \u00a32,173,246 was paid\ninto the fraudulent account between 2009 and 2010 using false invoices.\nConclusions\nThe procurement manager was found guilty of fraud by abuse of position and was jailed for seven\nyears. The necessary assurances were not in place to appropriately manage the risks.\n13) Catering Equipment \u2013 paid for but not supplied\nWhat happened?\nAn investigation was undertaken into procurement irregularities following a routine audit, which\nindicated that catering equipment had been paid for but not supplied to schools on whose behalf it\nhad supposedly been ordered. The investigation found that an employee had raised a number of\npurchase orders and made payments totalling in excess of \u00a350,000 for catering equipment with a\nsupplier, yet there was no evidence that the goods had been supplied.\nEnquiries found that many of the items were not required and had never been requested by the\nschools on whose behalf the orders had been placed. The supplier appeared to have colluded with\n1 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-17937293this activity as there was no other plausible explanation for them to submit invoices and accept\npayment for goods they had not supplied.\nHow was it discovered?\nThe investigation started as a result of a routine audit, which indicated that catering equipment had\nbeen paid for but not supplied.\nConclusions\nThe lack of division of duties which allowed an employee to place orders and approve invoices for\npayment was a key factor in the commission of the fraud, the full extent of which could not be\nestablished due to the absence of supporting documentation. The absence of a corporate contract\nfor the supply of this type of equipment was another factor. The employee resigned at the outset of\nthe investigation and the supplier agreed to refund the payments which they had received.\nThe council ceased all involvement with the supplier.\n14) Unnecessary work and overcharging\nWhat happened?\nAn investigation was undertaken in a school concerning the cost of orders placed by the Schools\nBusiness Manager. Nearly \u00a3350,000 of orders had been made over a two-year period to two\nsuppliers for property maintenance work and IT equipment. This work was awarded in breach of\nfinancial procedures by failing to obtain quotes and/or by deliberate order splitting. These suppliers\nwere subsequently found to be unsuitable for much of the work undertaken, which by and large was\ndeemed to be unnecessary and the cost excessive. It was strongly suspected the owners of both\nfirms were known to the School Business Manager in a personal capacity, and in all probability were\nawarded unnecessary and/or overpriced work for personal gain.\nHow was it discovered?\nAn investigation was undertaken at a school after concerns were raised about the cost of orders\nbeing placed by the School Business Manager.\nConclusions\nThe School Business manager, who subsequently resigned, was responsible for all aspects of\nprocurement within the school and had placed orders without any consultation with the heads of\ndepartments on whose behalf he was procuring goods and services.\n15) Contract to rebuild adventure playground following fire damage\nWhat happened?\nThe officer tasked with the rebuild project of an adventure playground following fire damage used\nthe fact that it was an \u2018insurance job\u2019 to not follow proper procurement process and did not go out\nto tender as was required for the value of work involved. The work was given to a friend who was\njust starting out a business. The officer was also helping the friend with aspects of the new business.\nThe value of the rebuild contract was \u00a366,000.\nConclusionsOfficer was dismissed following a disciplinary process. Appealed but failed to attend the hearing. The\ndecision was upheld.\n16) Misuse of Fuel Card\nWhat happened?\nEmployee retained a fuel card from a temporary replacement vehicle and then made fuel purchases\nfor his own vehicle and of others to the sum of around \u00a34,000. Monitoring of the use of cards was\nnot being carried out at the time.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe monitoring of use of fuel cards was resting with individual budget managers, a decision had\nbeen taken to centralise the monitoring as there was a concern it was not being monitored. It was\nthe centralisation of the monitoring that flagged up some purchases that were for unleaded petrol\nbut were registered to a diesel vehicle, or purchases were registered to fleet vehicles not in use on\nthe day of purchase, or not part of the fleet.\nConclusions\nEmployee was dismissed following a disciplinary process and was invoiced for the cost of the fuel he\nhad purchased with the card.\n17) Contractor favoured in exchange for bribes\nWhat happened?\nElectrical engineer was favouring an electrical contractor in exchange for bribes. The Engineer fixed\ntenders by tailoring specifications to ensure the contractor won some school rewiring jobs. This was\ncarried out by including specific requirements for the use of the alarm installation contractor which\nwere then not imposed on the favoured contractor, allowing them to under-cut the competitor bids\nby \u00a314,000 and thereby secure the work.\nHow was this discovered?\nThis came from a tip off from the individual who had set up the electrical company in question, but\nwas unhappy with some of the underhand dealings going on. The individual gave up his shareholding\nin the company and came to the council with the allegations.\nConclusions\nThis case was not reported to the police but the electrical engineer was dismissed following a\ndisciplinary process for:\n\u2022 Attendance at hospitality events with the contractor.\n\u2022 Close friendship with contractor and evidence of socialising with them.\n\u2022 Having private work carried out and paid for by the contractor.\n18) Inflated prices and bribes to Council surveyor\nWhat happened?The costs of fencing jobs were inflated and a council landscape surveyor was taking a cut on the\nprofit of each job. The individual jobs were between \u00a31,500 and \u00a310,000 in value. Both the\ncontractor involved and the surveyor were prosecuted and given eight month prison sentences and\nthe Council was awarded \u00a316,766 from each of them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\nHow was this discovered?\nThis came from an anonymous whistle-blower who provided documentation showing the council\njobs and the agreed percentage split with the Council surveyor.\nConclusions\nThe Council involved the police at an early stage and they raided the contractor\u2019s premises seizing\ndocuments, computers and other material. Following prosecution the individual ceased being a\ndirector of the company, but the company continued to trade under the other director.\nThere was no formal contract in place between the contractor and the Council, in contravention of\nthe council procedures. Following the investigation, the work was retendered following the correct\nprocess.\n19) Goods ordered for personal use and resale\nWhat happened?\nA member of staff in the Independent Living Service within the Council purchased \u00a3117,060.32 of\nitems which would not be required by the service/client between 1st April 2005 and 5th March\n2012. Orders for these goods were placed by a Team Leader and concerns were raised by a manager\nfollowing a budget review. The fraud took advantage of a \u00a3300 threshold where orders do not\nrequire authorisation and a particular arrangement with a retailer involving a trade card where no\norder went to the supplier.\nHow was this discovered?\nThis came to light as the Manager spotted that the expenditure was not aligning to the budget. She\ncalled in Internal Audit who looked at the purchases and found items being purchased that were not\nconsistent with the service. The purchases were being resold on Ebay.\nConclusions\nThe member of staff received a 20-month jail sentence and confiscation order.\n20) Referral to the Competition and Markets Authority\nWhat happened?\nSimilarities in two bids as part of a procurement exercise were identified by members of the\ncouncil\u2019s procurement team. This was referred to the corporate Investigations Team who were able\nto confirm that the bids looked similar and a referral was made to the Competition and Markets\nAuthority in relation to the suspected cartel activity. After carefully reviewed the bids they decided\nto issue formal warnings to the two companies involved.\n21) Fraud by Abuse of Position \u2013 works procurement\nWhat happened?The Council Housing Manager created fictitious suppliers in order to pay third parties money that\nthey were not entitled to. He also created false documentation supporting the payments including\nfake letter heads, fake email accounts and forged letters of application for grant funding. In some\ncases false company identifies were created with genuine bank details.\nThe Housing Manager requested payment to the fictious suppliers for work that was not carried out.\nIn some cases addresses given for the location of work did not exist. Payment requests were\nsupported by false invoices and quotes and forged letters of application. All payments were sent to\nthe individual\u2019s manager who failed to check the authenticity of the documentation or the need for\nthe requested work.\nThe Housing Manager was a well-liked and trusted individual who relied on this trust to get his\npayments authorised, as although the paperwork was poorly forged it was not subject to scrutiny.\nHe also relied on the fact his Manager was negligent in the exercise of his responsibilities, approving\nthese requests without question or scrutiny.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe fraud was identified through a new Accounts Payable Department check which revealed that a\nsupplier had the same bank details as two other suppliers registered on the system. The Housing\nManager approached another member of staff in an attempt to have evidence deleted.\nInvestigative steps\nExamination of the individual\u2019s council laptop and records provided evidence of further frauds. All\nthe properties concerned (where they existed) were visited and the occupants provided witness\nstatements. All the companies whose documentation had been forged were visited and statements\ntaken.\nSearch warrants were executed on two addresses and three individuals were arrested and\ninterviewed under caution. The recipients of the funds were also interviewed under caution.\nConclusions\nThe individual was charged with three counts of fraud by abuse of position contrary to sections 1\nand 4 of the Fraud Act 2006 and one count of attempted fraud by abuse of position contrary to\nsection 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 amounting to \u00a3307,401. He was sentenced to 18\nmonths\u2019 immediate imprisonment.\n22) Fraud by abuse of position \u2013 Social Care Procurement\nWhat happened?\nA finance officer manipulated the council\u2019s finance system for social care direct payments. The\npayments of monies to adults was processed through an intermediary charity who held the money\non behalf of the adult. An adult would then commission their own carer who would be paid by the\nintermediary on the production of invoices. In some cases adults would accrue credit balances with\nthe intermediary where they had not used the full amount of the direct payment monies awarded to\nthem.\nThe finance officer sought recovery of these credit balances from the intermediary back to the\ncouncil to use for another adult, fabricating a story for the intermediary to explain that the money\nshould instead be paid to another adult rather than the council directly. The account details\nprovided were the Finance Officer\u2019s own private bank account details.How was this discovered?\nThe fraud was identified after a member of staff noticed that the account details being given for\ndifferent \u2018adults\u2019 were the same as a previous request. This highlighted previous emails and the\nfraud was uncovered.\nConclusions\nThe Finance Officer made a full admission of the fraud in the interview under caution, when\nchallenged with the transactions. Bank statements gained through production orders were utilised\nto identify in excess of \u00a345,000 of illicit payments to the Finance Officer\u2019s own bank accounts.\nThe Finance Officer was sentenced to 20 months immediate imprisonment and through the\nProceeds of Crime Act all monies were then recovered, as well as the investigation costs, totalling\n\u00a345,987.23.\nThe \u2018refund\u2019 process in these circumstances never had any escalation sign-off, nor any independent\nauditing of the transactions carried out over the course of the payments from the council. The\nFinance Officer took advantage of that control weakness. Since the issue was identified, additional\nlayers of authority in both the intermediary and the council were introduced.\n23) Employee Corruption\nWhat happened?\nA member of the housing department colluded with her husband, a supplier of cleaning services, to\ninflate costs charged to the council and to provide work to her husband\u2019s business. The supplier had\ninitially been set up to carry out a one-off cleaning job in the sum of \u00a3900, but had been paid\n\u00a3126,000 over the year. The member of the housing department did not disclose this conflict of\ninterest. After 6 months the cleaning company changed its bank account details from a business\nbank account number to a personal bank account number. The company had been struck-off by\ncompanies\u2019 house after the six-month period for failing to file records.\nAn inspection of the work conducted by the supplier identified sub-standard work, including missing\n\u2018white goods\u2019 purchased for properties by the council, which were purchased between 6-12 months\nof going missing.\nHow was this discovered?\nA proactive fraud drive looked across all council spend in one year against the contracts register to\nensure compliance with the procurement rules \u2013 i.e. contracts over \u00a310,000 having a contract. One\nparticular supplier was found where \u00a3126,000 had been spent over the year on \u2018cleaning services\u2019\nbut no contract was in place.\nConclusions\nAnalysis of the officer\u2019s email account identified communication with her husband about charging\nrates and increasing charging as the council \u2018will pay more from the budget.\u2019\nThe officer was interviewed under caution and made a full admission and was suspended from the\ncouncil pending a disciplinary hearing. The officer resigned the following day and left the council\nbefore the disciplinary hearing was held.A search warrant was executed at the supplier\u2019s trading address to identify missing white goods and\nrecords for the work completed but no white goods were found.\nThe supplier was also interviewed under caution who gave no comment. The council ceased using\nthe supplier and removed them from the contracts list. A full file was shared with HMRC on the\ntrading activity for the company director.\nValue: \u00a336,168.86\n24) Potential collusion amongst bidders\nWhat happened?\nPicked up a suspicion of collusion in the responses of two bidders.\nHow was it discovered?\nAn individual picked this up whilst evaluating respective bids and investigating through companies\u2019\nhouse.\nConclusions\nDemonstrates team working between procurement and internal audit to investigate irregularities.\n25) Kickbacks in exchange for contracts\nWhat happened?\nA housing project manager took bribes from suppliers in relation to contracts they were awarded by\nthe Council. He was given \u00a3125,000 by a contractor that was awarded a \u00a32 million contract for works\non council-owned properties. The estimated total lost to the council was \u00a3720,000, and the project\nmanager is estimated to have personally gained \u00a3400,000. The project manager was also bribed with\ntickets to premiership football matches, meals and golf trips.\nIn addition to accepting bribes, the housing project manager also paid firms for inspection work\nwhich was either never completed or unnecessary.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe project manager\u2019s misconduct was eventually uncovered by a colleague, who reported him to\nthe council\u2019s internal audit department.\nConclusions\nThe council officer was jailed for three and a half years after he admitted five counts of conspiracy to\ncommit misconduct in public office, one count of committing misconduct in public office and one\ncharge of fraud by abuse of position. Three other defendants were given a range of suspended jail\nterms for their involvement.\n26) Documentation falsified to cover up personal spending on credit card\nWhat happened?\nThe officer responsible for processing purchases on behalf of care leavers - for items such as\nclothing, electrical goods, travel tickets \u2013 stole \u00a32,559.59 for personal purchases.The officer used pdf editing software to amend genuine authorised purchase requisitions from the\nsocial care system to create falsified documentation to cover up personal expenditure using a\ncorporate credit card, petty cash and the corporate travel booking system.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe fraud came to light when a manager identified anomalies in relation to paperwork supporting\ntransactions and called in Internal Audit to undertake an investigation.\nConclusions\nIt was found that the service had introduced an additional manual check of transactions into the\nauthorisation process and that this had been exploited with the falsified documentation. The\nelectronic authorisations were based upon the manual checks and as a result failed to identify the\nwrongdoing.\nThe fraud was found to total \u00a32,559.59 broken down as follows; corporate credit card \u00a31,460.09,\ntravel booking system \u00a3746.15 and petty cash \u00a3353.35.\nThe officer was dismissed for gross misconduct and a referral made to the police. In addition, control\nweaknesses that had enabled the fraud to take place were addressed.\nThe key lesson to be learned is that the introduction of an additional manual process inadvertently\nweakened the overall control environment and undermined the automated approval process.\n27) School credit card used for personal purchases\nWhat happened?\nA school finance officer used the school credit card to purchase personal items. This was possible\ndue to a breakdown in controls such as separation of duties and management checks by the\nheadteacher.\nHow was this discovered?\nThe fraud was discovered when a new headteacher took up post and was concerned over the level\nof expenditure and lack of supporting documentation. Internal Audit was called in and undertook a\nthorough investigation to determine the extent of the fraud although the officer had been allowed\nto resign prior to this.\nConclusions\nThe investigation identified inappropriate expenditure on the school credit card totalling \u00a33,567.58\nas well as misappropriated income and the matter was referred to the police for further\ninvestigation.\nThe former finance officer subsequently pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position as well as theft\nfrom an employer and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment (suspended for 2 years), 200\nhours unpaid work and a 3-month curfew order. In a subsequent hearing the former finance officer\nwas ordered to repay the Council a total of \u00a38,601.22."
